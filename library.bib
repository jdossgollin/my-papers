"the financial, social, and environmental performance of infrastructure investments is, in fact, strikingly poor (Flyvbjerg et~al., 2002, 2003, 2005, 2009; Flyvbjerg and Budzier, 2011; Ansar et~al., 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=2}{Ansar et al 2016:361})

"How can poor outcomes of individual infrastructure investment projects amount to economic welfare in the aggregate? The macro and micro studies seem at loggerheads over the impact of infrastructure investments on economic prosperity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=2}{Ansar et al 2016:361})

"The macroeconomic account of infrastructure investments in China, for instance, omits the massive costs incurred in the building of megaprojects" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=3}{Ansar et al 2016:362})

"We hypothesize that debt-financed overinvestment in infrastructure contributes to underperformance and instability in the economy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=3}{Ansar et al 2016:362})

"Where direct productivity effects were found to be weak or not found at all, the macro-studies began to insist on indirect impacts through spillover effects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=4}{Ansar et al 2016:363})

"Vickerman (2007, p.~598) similarly argues that the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of large-scale infrastructure projects, 'needs to be able to incorporate network impacts which are notoriously difficult to identify and model'." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=5}{Ansar et al 2016:364})

"Using data from 258 transport infrastructure projects, Flyvbjerg et~al. (2002, p.~279) found that the cost estimates used to decide whether such projects should be built were 'highly and systematically misleading. Underestimation cannot be explained by error and is best explained by strategic misrepresentation, that is, lying'." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=5}{Ansar et al 2016:364})

"The result of these realpolitik tactics in the appraisal, selection, and building of infrastructure projects is an unhealthy 'survival of the unfittest' by which the 'worst infrastructure gets built' (Flyvbjerg, 2009)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=6}{Ansar et al 2016:365})

"From a micro perspective, the implication of delusion and deception in infrastructure projects is that these twin forces profoundly undermine the economic return of the individual infrastructure projects that get built." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=7}{Ansar et al 2016:366})

"We address ourselves to the paradox of how can poor outcomes of infrastructure investment projects\textemdash{}as reported in micro-level studies\textemdash{}amount to economic welfare in the aggregate?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=7}{Ansar et al 2016:366})

"data on the actual, ex post outcomes related to the benefits, cost, and time of a sample of 95 road2 and rail3 infrastructure projects in China built from 1984 to 2008 across 19 (out of 22)~provinces, four (out of four) municipalities, and four (out of five) autonomous regions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=8}{Ansar et al 2016:367})

"In brief, China has built infrastructure at impressive speed in the past but, it appears, by trading-off due consideration for quality, safety, social equity, and the environment. The frequent laments by politicians in rich democracies that public consultation processes amount to 'dithering' are misguided (see Johnson, 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=15}{Ansar et al 2016:374})

"Thus a majority of routes witnessed paltry traffic volumes while a few routes were highly congested, as follows." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=15}{Ansar et al 2016:374})

"equally" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=16}{Ansar et al 2016:375})

\emph{Hmm, they're both bad but in different ways -- perhaps not exactly equal? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=16}{note on p.375})}

"There was no plausible scenario in which\textemdash{}after suffering a 24 per cent cost overrun, a 49 per cent traffic shortfall, and a 53 per cent toll-price shortfall\textemdash{}the YuanMo expressway could yield a positive return. The project destroyed economic~value." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=17}{Ansar et al 2016:376})

"We advance: Hypothesis 1. Due to a propensity to cost overruns and benefit shortfalls, the typical infrastructure investment destroys economic~value. Policy Proposition 1. Less is more. Policy-makers should only commit scarce public resources to infrastructure alternatives that, even after accounting for potential cost overruns and benefit shortfalls, produce positive economic value." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=18}{Ansar et al 2016:377})

"Hypothesis 2. Direct benefits, e.g. financial cash flows, at the project-level will be a more robust measure of the actual benefits of infrastructure investments than wider economic benefits or network effects. Policy Proposition 2: Instead of enumerating many, potentially obscure, dimensions of future benefits, policy-makers should focus on one simple metric\textemdash{}such as the actual Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) or revenues\textemdash{}for infrastructure investments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=19}{Ansar et al 2016:378})

"China built its infrastructure after\textemdash{}rather than before\textemdash{} many years of economic growth and accumulation of financial resources." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=20}{Ansar et al 2016:379})

"The most tangible consequences of poor investment decisions have been an accumulation of a destabilizing pile of debt in the economy; unprecedented monetary expansion\textemdash{}even larger than the quantitative easing programmes of the US, the Euro area, the UK, and Japan combined\textemdash{}and subsequent economic fragility to financial crises. Less tangible, but perhaps even more damaging, are the opportunities forgone to build the right infrastructure." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=20}{Ansar et al 2016:379})

\emph{The fragility to financial crises is a super key point! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=20}{note on p.379})}

~

"However, China's relatively low official government debt-to-GDP ratio understates the actual debt burden the government carries for the following two reasons: corporate borrowing (125 per cent of China's GDP) and financial institution borrowing (65 per cent of China's GDP) are dominated by state-owned or state-controlled entities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=22}{Ansar et al 2016:381})

"Road and rail projects have a lower mean cost overrun than other asset types such as large dams (M~=~96 per cent; Ansar et~al., 2014) or nuclear power plants (M~=~207 per cent; Schlissel and Biewald, 2008, p.8)\textemdash{}investments China has made in abundance. Moreover, World Bank and ADB-financed projects are likely to have better performance than the average Chinese project, making our estimate from the reference class~conservative" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=23}{Ansar et al 2016:382})

"The ability of the Chinese state to absorb future liabilities of an ageing population\textemdash{}pensions, elderly care, and health\textemdash{}is a pressing concern, and it will depend on how China otherwise spends its money, including on infrastructure." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=24}{Ansar et al 2016:383})

"Sacrificing national wealth to build negative NPV investments, such as many of China's infrastructure projects, is economically not prudent." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AXU8MIR7?page=25}{Ansar et al 2016:384})

"Hypothesis 3. Cost overruns and revenue shortfalls from poor infrastructure investments will cause a build-up of debt and the risk of economic fragility. Policy Proposition 3. Policy-makers should place a razor-sharp focus on direct projectlevel cash flows. Choose infrastructure investment alternatives that can generate a positive financial NPV after incorporating the risk of going over budget, time, or under benefits."

"For example, the World Commission of Dams (2000, p. 30) reported that for large hydropower dams "average [hydropower] generation in thefirst year of commercial operation is 80\% of the targeted value"\textemdash{}a trend of which the recently completed Bakun hydroelectric project in Borneo is an alarming example (Sovacool and Bulan, 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=2}{Ansar et al 2014:44})

"Duflo and Pande (2007)find adverse distributional impacts of large irrigation dams in India." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=2}{Ansar et al 2014:44})

"Wefind that even before accounting for negative impacts on human society and environment, the actual construction costs of large dams are too high to yield a positive return." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=2}{Ansar et al 2014:44})

"Ourfindings, however, point towards the generalizable policy proposition that policymakers should prefer energy alternatives that require less upfront outlays and that can be built very quickly." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=2}{Ansar et al 2014:44})

"To take an outside view on the outcome of an action (or event) is to place it in the statistical distribution of the outcomes of comparable, already-concluded, actions (or events)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=2}{Ansar et al 2014:44})

"country specific factors have been taken into account the factor that drives cost overrun is the planning horizon. finally suggests that once" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=9}{Ansar et al 2014:51})

"The best insurance against creeping inflation is to reduce the implementation schedule to as short a horizon as possible. Energy alternatives that can be built sooner and with lower risk of schedule overruns, e.g. through modular design, are preferable." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=11}{Ansar et al 2014:53})

"These case examples reinforce the essential message of our statistical results: bigger projects entail uncontrollable risks," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=11}{Ansar et al 2014:53})

"which even when anticipatable cannot be adequately hedged." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=11}{Ansar et al 2014:53})

"The Diamer-Bhasha dam is a non-starter in Pakistan. This is without even discussing potential effects of inflation and interest rates, potential social and environmental costs, and opportunity cost Pakistan could earn by committing such vast amount of capital to more prudent investments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2DIBV27N?page=13}{Ansar et al 2014:55})

"Large dams also exert an opportunity cost by consuming scarce resources that could be deployed to better uses, sinking vast amounts of land that could have yielded cashflows and jobs from agricultural, timber, or mineral resources."

"the expected benefits of structural protection measures preventing frequent flooding often outweigh their building costs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=2}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5630})

"increasing levels of flood protection can also be associated with unexpected increases in flood exposure." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=2}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5630})

"flood risk can even increase in the medium-long term after the introduction or reinforcement of a structural flood protection (Kates et al., 2006; Montz and Tobin, 2008; Di Baldassarre et al., 2013b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=2}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5630})

"The study showed that the urban area that can be potentially flooded has increased six-fold during the 20th century" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=2}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5630})

"These studies showed that an important component of such an attitude is the false sense of security induced by the presence of (often impressive) structural works designed to limit risk and prevent damage." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=3}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5631})

"these studies are fragmented and have used completely different methods, hampering comparative analyses" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4YUSW2A7?page=4}{Di Baldassarre et al 2018:5632})

This is a nice study which summarizes the levee effect, what is known, and what is unknown.

I'll be curious to keep an eye on this work into the coming years. If they get long records and good data, we could learn something -- otherwise I'm skeptical that we can quantify this effect very well.},

"Protection works have been triggered by development but, conversely, development has been boosted by the existence of protection works when people saw the opportunity of building into protected zones." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=2}{Barendrecht et al 2017:4})

"reflect on a dynamic concept for flood risk involving a two-way coupling of processes associated with floods and people" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=3}{Barendrecht et al 2017:5})

"Initially, the government changed the system to reflect local flood risk in the insurance fees. However, once citizens in flood prone areas realised that their insurance fees had dramatically increased, there was substantial political pressure to revert to the previous system of uniform fees across all contributors. Grelot and Barreteau [22] showed that an insurance system with fees independent of flood risk may result in people moving closer to the river, which is known as 'call effect', and consequently an increased risk, if no additional policies (such as land use regulation) are implemented." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=3}{Barendrecht et al 2017:5})

"The first may arise from the complexity of the system dynamics, such as the levee effect" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=4}{Barendrecht et al 2017:6})

"biased human perceptions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=4}{Barendrecht et al 2017:6})

"Di Baldassarre et al. [16] show that, in Africa, flood risk has been increasing in the past decades mainly due to an increase in exposure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=4}{Barendrecht et al 2017:6})

"Once the variables of the system have been specified in an unambiguous way, the interactions between these variables can be identified." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=4}{Barendrecht et al 2017:6})

"Models that represent the dynamic phenomena and feedbacks of the previous sections may be classified, according to their complexity, into (a) system-of-systems models, and (b) stylised models [35]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{Barendrecht et al 2017:8})

\emph{Modeling all the complex feedbacks are really difficult. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{note on p.8})}

"Stylised models, on the other hand, are simple/parsimonious models that directly couple the hydrologic and societal parts of the system." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{Barendrecht et al 2017:8})

"They are used for generalising the understanding of phenomena beyond individual case studies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{Barendrecht et al 2017:8})

"Most of the coupled human-flood models reviewed in this paper are internally deterministic with external forcing that may be stochastic (i.e., flood occurrence and magnitude)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{Barendrecht et al 2017:8})

\emph{State of art is deterministic model with stochastic forcing (!) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=6}{note on p.8})}

"Two scenarios of flood damage for a hypothetical city" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MYAXCC5I?page=7}{Barendrecht et al 2017:9})

This is a nice review paper that (i) makes the point that we need to consider how human and natural systems may be coupled to form total risk or loss; (ii) outlines the current state of the art; and (iii) provides some nice examples such as Vienna. While I think they're right that this is a really important feature to consider, I'm also a bit pessimistic; I trust the physical models very little, the economic models far less, and their combined outputs not at all. The causal loop diagrams, or conceptual models, that they propose may be helpful, but it's hard to know how to use them in specific applications. Ultimately I think they're right that this is an important area of future research!}

  annotation = {As annotations will reveal, I don't much like this approach. I actually think it's a useful tool, though, but only when (1) uncertainties are parametric in nature rather than deep, and (2) the performance metrics are "real" an meaningful.

For example, making sure a spring can provide a given amount of force given uncertainty in the spring constant is a good application because F=-kx is a good equation, and because the performance metric is clearly specified.

On the other hand, when used for design and investment problems in infrastructure planning, the performance metrics are not real. We never provide 100\% reliability. If we can provide 98\% reliability for half the cost of 99\% reliability, is imposing 99\% reliability always the right thing to do? Shouldn't we make that tradeoff available to the decision-maker?

\textbf{Extracted Annotations (19/11/2019, 11:11:36)}

"However, if one's models will be much better next year when new knowledge has become available (but you must decide now), or if processes are changing in poorly known ways, or if important factors will be determined beyond your knowledge or control, then one faces deep uncertainty and IG theory might help." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{Ben-Haim 2019:94})

\emph{Good articulation of the problem but not sure how IG helps (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{note on p.94})}

"Knight (1921) distinguished between what he called "risk" (for which probability distributions are known) and "true uncertainty" (for which probability distributions are not known). Knightian ("true") uncertainty reflects ignorance of many things, including underlying processes, functional relationships, strategies or intentions of relevant actors, future events, inventions, discoveries, surprises, and so on." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{Ben-Haim 2019:94})

\emph{Good summary of Knightian uncertainty (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{note on p.94})}

"Infogap models of uncertainty provide a non-probabilistic quantification of Knightian uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{Ben-Haim 2019:94})

\emph{No they don't, and pretending otherwise is dangerous (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{note on p.94})}

"An info-gap model of uncertainty is particularly suitable for representing uncertainty in the shape of a function." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{Ben-Haim 2019:94})

\emph{Yes and some of the examples here are fair because the *functional form is known* and there is just parametric uncertainty (eg, stress-strain curve)\\
However in the water resources world, parametric uncertainties are the least of our concern (at least, this is what the deep uncertainty literature tells us) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=2}{note on p.94})}

"This is the idea of satisficing introduced by Simon (1956): achieving a satisfactory or acceptable, but not necessarily optimal, outcome\textemdash{}"good enough" according to an explicitly stated set of criteria." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{Ben-Haim 2019:95})

\emph{But how sensitive are results to the level of satisficing imposed? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{note on p.95})}

"The same can be said of the public official who must reduce crime below a legislative target, or the foreign aid planner who must raise public health to international standards." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{Ben-Haim 2019:95})

\emph{This may be true in *implementation*, but when *designing* policies, satisficing may lead to sub-optimal outcomes because, in the presence of tradeoffs, you restrict yourself from considering the full space of possible decisions (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{note on p.95})}

"Min-max or worst-case analysis is a widely used alternative to outcome optimization when facing deep uncertainty and bears some similarity to IG robustness." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{Ben-Haim 2019:95})

\emph{min-max analysis is an utter crock of shit in that, if you take tail probabilities seriously, every action has a non-zero probability of massively negative harm, and making decision based only on this one worst case, rather than on the full distribution of utility | action, is ridiculous (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=3}{note on p.95})}

"worst possible outcome" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=4}{Ben-Haim 2019:96})

\emph{we use only the worst possible outcome, over the set of outcomes that we think a priori are likely, which sidesteps the entire point of deep uncertainty and "unknown unknowns" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=4}{note on p.96})}

"How much could the model change without violating the performance requirements?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=6}{Ben-Haim 2019:98})

\emph{1) why are the performance requirements fixed?\\
2) to what kinds of uncertainty are we robust? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=6}{note on p.98})}

"IG robustness is based on three components: a system model, an info-gap uncertainty model, and one or more performance requirements" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=12}{Ben-Haim 2019:104})

"Given two options that are approximately equivalent in other respects but one is more robust than the other, the robust-satisficing decisionmaker will prefer the more robust option." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=12}{Ben-Haim 2019:104})

\emph{I agree with this statement -- the problem with this methodology is that you throw out  (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=12}{note on p.104})}

"The robustness is the greatest value of h up to which m(h) is no less than xc" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7VCKSAYJ?page=13}{Ben-Haim 2019:105})},

"In most modern societies decisions with respect to water resources and, more broadly, water security are still largely based on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (Stakhiv, 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=1}{Borgomeo et al 2018:468})

"Analyzing the risk of harmful outcomes, which is an integral part of this version of CBA, involves estimating the probability and consequences of risks (like flood, droughts, or pollution incidents) with and without the proposed intervention\textemdash{}which might entail investments in supply or storage infrastructure, measures to reduce leakage, or interventions to promote more efficient use of water." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{Borgomeo et al 2018:469})

\emph{Good sentence (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{note on p.469})}

"The recognition of nonstationarity and need to expand the tenets of operational hydrology and traditional water system analysis has given rise to a range of methods for decision-making under uncertainty, such as Robust-Decision Making, decision scaling, vulnerability analysis, and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (for a review, see Maier et al., 2016). These approaches are based on a shared set of principles. First, they identify conditions under which the performance of the water investment becomes unacceptable prior to assigning probabilities to these conditions (Brown et al., 2012; Groves \& Lempert, 2007; Lempert et al., 2006; Nazemi et al., 2013; Prudhomme et al., 2010; Turner et al., 2014). Second, they emphasize robustness to uncertainty, broadly defined as a decision that performs acceptably well under a wide range of plausible future conditions (Herman et al., 2014; Hine \& Hall, 2010; Matrosov et al., 2013; Moody \& Brown, 2013; Trindade et al., 2017). Third, these approaches highlight the importance of flexibility in water investments, that is, the ability to switch or change a decision depending on what outcomes materialize (Groves et al., 2015; Haasnoot et al., 2013; Hino \& Hall, 2017; Jeuland \& Whittington, 2014; Kwakkel et al., 2015; Woodward et al., 2011; Zeff et al., 2016). Fourth, they strongly emphasize the multiobjective nature of all water investments and the need to explore the trade-offs between these multiple objectives under uncertainty (Barbour et al., 2016; Giuliani et al., 2014; Huskova et al., 2016; Kasprzyk et al., 2013; Matrosov et al., 2015; Mortazavi et al., 2012; Paton et al., 2014; Reed et al., 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{Borgomeo et al 2018:469})

\emph{This is a really good paragraph that summarizes a lot of the new methods for decision-making under uncertainty and that we should borrow heavily from. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{note on p.469})}

"However, robustness is seldom cost-free (Ben Haim, 2006). There is usually a trade-off between the performance achieved by a system under ideal conditions and the robustness that system has across a wide range of uncertain, and possibly unforeseen, futures." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{Borgomeo et al 2018:469})

\emph{Robustness isn't free -- we have trade-offs between performance under ideal conditions and performance under non-ideal conditions (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=2}{note on p.469})}

"a water resources management decision under uncertainty is undertaken with a sound understanding of (1) its consequences, in terms of the costs of these investments (how much do proposed plans cost? how much will this cause water bills to increase?) and in terms of the benefits (how many fewer people will experience shortages? what will the avoided costs be?) and (2) its robustness, where we recognize the multiple definitions of robustness and argue that metrics suitable to the decision at hand should be selected" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=3}{Borgomeo et al 2018:470})

"First, it demonstrates how to trade-off robustness with the costs of water investments for different risk attitudes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=3}{Borgomeo et al 2018:470})

"assessing the consequences of a decision begins with quantifying the probability of not meeting a desired standard for that particular decision or condition. In water resources management, this has been interpreted as the probability of not meeting a desired frequency of water use restrictions of different levels of severity (Hall et al., 2012)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=4}{Borgomeo et al 2018:471})

\emph{We need to really hit on this point. This is how risk is often considered, but this is arbitrary. If you hedge your risks, this goes away and condenses to a distribution of cash outcomes which you can then measure your risk aversion over. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=4}{note on p.471})}

"Robustness has been considered as a decision objective in several studies (Beh et al., 2017; Mortazavi-Naeini et al., 2015; Ray et al., 2013)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=5}{Borgomeo et al 2018:472})

"daily weather sequences over the Thames basin from the weather@home2 platform (Guillod et al., 2017b)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=7}{Borgomeo et al 2018:474})

"The minimax criterion was employed to measure robustness under a range of scenarios wider than that considered to estimate the risk metric in Equation (1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=11}{Borgomeo et al 2018:478})

\emph{I also really dislike this minimax criterion approach -- the problem is that the sample max of a process with fat tails is not well behaved (can prove that max of a process isn't well behaved and I suspect Q99.9 of Cauchy doesn't converge) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=11}{note on p.478})}

\emph{Like why would you put a criteria on this lol (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=13}{note on p.480})}

"45{$\circ$} slope of the cost-risk curve is is selected (triangle in Figure 5)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=13}{Borgomeo et al 2018:480})

\emph{But, why not just (1) raise rates; and (2) pay the expected restriction cost as a fine to the users and be done with it -- then you are minimizing x + y which is easy. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WKYXEIN?page=13}{note on p.480})}},

"In decision scaling, the premise is that discussion of appropriate downscaling methods should follow and be informed by the formal modeling of the decision of interest." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=1}{Brown et al 2012:1})

\emph{Premise: identified needs drive modeling choices (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=1}{note on p.1})}

"Probabilities may be derived as a quantification of the range of climate change information available and are best understood as model based or subjective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{Brown et al 2012:2})

\emph{sure, aren't they all? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"1961]. The results do not attempt to provide "optimal" solutions in the traditional decision analytic sense. Instead, the approach identifies the best decision conditional on the weight of the climate projection-based evidence." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{Brown et al 2012:2})

\emph{Isn't this exactly what we mean by "optimal" choices, though? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"They describe a "lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty" [Stainforth et al., 2007]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{Brown et al 2012:2})

\emph{right, even in BEST case scenario GCMs can provide an estimate of conditional p(theta | FORCING), and FORCING is unknown (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"The application of decision analysis to water resources under climate change uncertainty is surprisingly rare in the literature" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=3}{Brown et al 2012:3})

"Once the decision-influencing climate states are identified, climate information is tailored to estimate probabilities associated with those states" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=3}{Brown et al 2012:3})

\emph{The new vocabulary introduced here is a bit goofy, but the key insight is that the specific climate variables that actually impact human systems need to be identified. This can connect with the compound hazards literature. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=3}{note on p.3})}

"The understanding of the decision and context is then formalized through the creation of a decision system model that simulates system performance as a function of climate inputs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{Brown et al 2012:4})

\emph{attempting to estimate system performance as a function of climate inputs -- good, but limiting. we need to consider societal inputs. in our framework this is utility as a function of some variables. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{note on p.4})}

""climate response function,"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{Brown et al 2012:4})

\emph{first, this should be a stochastic function, not a deterministic one... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"In water resources systems analysis, the climate response function may simulate a hydrologic model and a water system model used sequentially. However, note that the climate response function is derived in terms of spatial domains and temporal resolution that characterize the system response to climate. Just as climate is characterized by the statistics of weather, the response may be characterized based on the statistics of the response of process models (i.e., hydrology and systems models) on weather time scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{Brown et al 2012:4})

\emph{useful point (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"it illuminates the degree to which the performance indicator values can be explained in terms of climate variables." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{Brown et al 2012:4})

\emph{a really key point that's missing here -- though it could be incorporated into the analysis -- is identifying your phase space. what are the climate variables you care about? \%change in precip and \%change in temperature don't seem right (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"In our is defined as imal (Figure 2). C  future climate conditions is calculated and ially varied" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=5}{Brown et al 2012:5})

\emph{I really don't like this decision formulation. There's a lot that goes into what makes an "optimal" decision. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=5}{note on p.5})}

"optimal" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=5}{Brown et al 2012:5})

\emph{I'd argue that you need much more formal decision analysis to ID an "optimal" solution -- climate is only a small part of your analysis. however, the idea that there may be different optimal solutions under different future climate states is a good one, and might inform the sequential planning work. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=5}{note on p.5})}

"'climate informed" is used to indicate probabilities based on climate projections which may be derived from GCMs or paleodata or stochastically generated and consequently, may differ from probabilities indicated solely by the historic record." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=6}{Brown et al 2012:6})

\emph{Seems like Casey ran his vocab past some people -- we can pick up on this term (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/REX4DTXN?page=6}{note on p.6})}

\emph{The challenge here is that mean temperature and mean precip aren't actually the things that you care about -- but they may co-vary with the things you care about or influence them (albeit in nonlinear ways).

"transmission relating to occupational specialization, as well as structural transformation and technology adoption in agriculture\textemdash{}through the introduction of Genetically Engineered (GE) soy seeds." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

"modern-day outcomes at the municipal and individual level" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

\emph{Hope to see more on data quality later? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{note on p.3})}

"single semi-nomadic indigenous group, so I can abstract from the differential effects of particular precolonial ethnic tribes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

\emph{sure, but with substantial variation -- people who live along the Paran\'a will behave differently from those who live 50km away in the woods (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{note on p.3})}

"all of the municipalities in the provinces of Misiones and Corrientes in Argentina, the states of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and Misiones and Itap\'ua in Paraguay (Figure I)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

"distance to the nearest mission as the main explanatory variable" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

"After controlling for geographic and weather characteristics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

\emph{Hope to see more on this later. I really dislike that so many people (both social sciences and my world) think that adding a column in your design matrix means you accounted for something, even if that something is very complex. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{note on p.3})}

"I find no significant or consistent effects for missions that were abandoned by the Jesuits" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{Caicedo 2018:3})

\emph{Hmm not sure I'm convinced by this as a placebo -- maybe it seemed like a good place until you found out that Pombero lived there (or mosquitos, or there was no water, etc) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=3}{note on p.3})}

"Second, I examine the impact of neighboring Guarani Franciscan missions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=4}{Caicedo 2018:4})

\emph{This is probably closer to a fair experiment -- but the two groups were also different politically and linked to different networks so there could be reasons other than "education and technical training" -- but this is probably the best comparison you can get (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"I build on growth theories of human capital accumulation, industrial specialization, and technology adoption" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=4}{Caicedo 2018:4})

\emph{Hope to see something that accounts for the fact that the country was completely wiped out in 1800s... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"at a time when returns to human capital were presumably low" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=6}{Caicedo 2018:6})

\emph{Maybe not? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=6}{note on p.6})}

"Jesuits introduced the printing press to Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and even established an astronomical observatory in San Cosme and Dami\'an, in modern-day Paraguay" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=8}{Caicedo 2018:8})

\emph{Something to check out! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=8}{note on p.8})}

"Jesuit missions still remained isolated from the colonial capital of Asunci\'on, which itself only numbered 6,451 inhabitants in 1761, and were only allowed to barter restrictively (Ganson, 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=8}{Caicedo 2018:8})

"ArcGIS" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=9}{Caicedo 2018:9})

\emph{huh? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=9}{note on p.9})}

"historical archives on the location, year of foundation, population, and general workings of the Guarani Jesuit missions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=10}{Caicedo 2018:10})

"I also collect a large set of geographic and weather controls at a highly disaggregated level from BIOCLIM and comparable sources." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=10}{Caicedo 2018:10})

\emph{I'd like to point out that it's really, really hard -- even now with best-available data sets -- to identify the suitability of a particular plot of land for a particular crop. We don't really understand the needs of different crops, but they're NOT "average temperature" or "average rainfall" and ARE things like "number of days after temperature below 15C with (1) soil moisture {$>$} some threshold(2) no rainfall sufficiently strong to cause erosion, and (3) good sunlight"  I really don't think that these very old data sets can provide any insight as to these types of variables which are actually relevant to agriculture (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=10}{note on p.10})}

"ruggedness, slope, and distance to rivers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=10}{Caicedo 2018:10})

\emph{are these non-standard? also, I hope that these are treated non-linearly..... for example, zero slope can be bad (no drainage) but too much slope is also bad. ditto for distance to rivers (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=10}{note on p.10})}

"municipality i in state j" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=11}{Caicedo 2018:11})

"To actually estimate the equation above, I use OLS" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=11}{Caicedo 2018:11})

\emph{Even if I thought this made any sense, you should be doing bayesian hierarchical model to reduce your noise and better estimate uncertainty. with so many correlated parameters, OLS can give you very crappy estimates. oh well I don't think that's the main issue here. but I do hope for a bit of model checking? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=11}{note on p.11})}

""coincidence"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=11}{Caicedo 2018:11})

"the Jesuits had "last pick" and presumably ended up in more peripheral areas" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=12}{Caicedo 2018:12})

"The farther away a municipality (in dots) is from a historical mission, the lower its literacy level today." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=12}{Caicedo 2018:12})

"endogenous," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=15}{Caicedo 2018:15})

"This might have been due to the threat of Portuguese slave-hunting bandeiras and the death of priests" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=15}{Caicedo 2018:15})

\emph{Yes -- I almost think that even if you believe all of the results, an alternate narrative would be that the negative consequences of slavery and oppression persist. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=15}{note on p.15})}

"Franciscan missions of Altos" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=16}{Caicedo 2018:16})

\emph{These are in a VERY different part of the country from the Jesuit missions around Encarnacion.  (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=16}{note on p.16})}

"Overall, they appear to be selected positively on these geographic attributes, consistent with the historical record." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=16}{Caicedo 2018:16})

\emph{Depends what your goal is! Unsurprisingly, at present these parts of the country have more robust campesino communities though large inequalities. By contrast, in Southern Paraguay (ie where the Jesuits were) there are larger plots and communities practice agriculture for sale. There is poverty in both places, but the climate favors different types of activity in different places. More people in Tobati, Ypane, Atyra, Caazapa, etc -- but higher chance of wealth in Southern Paraguay. Possibly also more inequality in the South too, which would sort of go against this narrative. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=16}{note on p.16})}

"Table VIII, Panel A" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=18}{Caicedo 2018:18})

\emph{This I do find somewhat compelling but the first-order narrative -- you put some schools in a few random places and unsurprisingly in the future that's where the schools still are -- isn't totally surprising. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=18}{note on p.18})}

""following the old missionary customs" (cited in G\'alvez, 1995, p. 392)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=19}{Caicedo 2018:19})

\emph{how does he know?! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=19}{note on p.19})}

"areas closer to missions in Brazil have moved away from agriculture to manufacturing and commerce" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=19}{Caicedo 2018:19})

"suggesting that structural transformation is a mechanism of" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=19}{Caicedo 2018:19})

"persistence for the missionary effect" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=20}{Caicedo 2018:20})

\emph{Or maybe it just so happened that the Parana river just turns out to be a great place for large factories?\\
I'd really like to see some of these figures as maps (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=20}{note on p.20})}

"FI GURE IIa" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=33}{Caicedo 2018:33})

\emph{This figure couldn't be any more unconvincing. Remove the 5 data points with literacy below 80\% which are clearly in the middle of nowhere and you have a zero slope line. (I'm not in general an advocate of removing outliers for a model -- just pointing out how sensitive this inference is to a few data points). (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=33}{note on p.33})}

"municipality centroid" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=33}{Caicedo 2018:33})

\emph{In a lot of places it's distance from a home to municipality centroid that matters far more for education -- muncipal-level data won't answer this at all! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=33}{note on p.33})}

"Plot" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=34}{Caicedo 2018:34})

\emph{This is not meaningfully different from previous plot (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=34}{note on p.34})}

"Unconditional binned scatter" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=35}{Caicedo 2018:35})

\emph{Binned scatter plots are not in general a helpful way to visualize this kind of data. Why not just use the previous figure (which we can all see!) instead of creating these highly noisy local estimates (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=35}{note on p.35})}

"Unconditional" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=36}{Caicedo 2018:36})

\emph{Again, what I'm seeing here is that there is basically no effect, but there is a slight increase in concentration of really poor places that are {$>$}= 125 km away from the missions. Are we really surprised that extreme poverty is higher in the most isolated areas? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=36}{note on p.36})}

"Plot" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=37}{Caicedo 2018:37})

\emph{Ditto of previous plot except now the slope is basically zero anyways (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=37}{note on p.37})}

"Unconditional" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=38}{Caicedo 2018:38})

\emph{Ditto -- stop doing this please (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=38}{note on p.38})}

"Unconditional" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=39}{Caicedo 2018:39})

\emph{This is a strange use of PCA... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=39}{note on p.39})}

"Unconditional" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=40}{Caicedo 2018:40})

\emph{Again these binned histograms are frustrating.  (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5XQNWWFD?page=40}{note on p.40})}},

"However, if and how that signal propagates out of the Arctic to mid-latitudes differs and can be loosely grouped under three broad dynamical frameworks: (1) changes in storm tracks mainly in the North Atlantic sector; (2) changes in the characteristics of the jet stream; and (3) regional changes in the tropospheric circulation that trigger anomalous planetary wave configurations."

"in most cases, a company's investments are multistaged, and at each step the company may push ahead or pull out after gaining new information. These projects are thus options\textemdash{}"real" options, as opposed to financial options\textemdash{}in which managers have the right but not the obligation to invest." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=1}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:1})

"As many executives point out, options embedded in management decisions are far more complex and ambiguous than financial options. Their concern is that it would be dangerous to try to reduce those complexities into standard option models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton model, which have only five or six variables" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=1}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:1})

"Much of the gap between the theoretical and realized values of companies' growth projects may be the result of a disconnect between the way managers value options and the way they manage them\textemdash{}a problem that, incidentally, applies to both real and financial options." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=2}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:2})

"What can managers do about the danger that real options will be exercised at the wrong time? They could give up on real options, throwing away a tool that ideally captures the contingencies in managing growth opportunities. Or they could adjust the model by assuming that their behavior will be suboptimal. That would give a more accurate value for the options\textemdash{}but at the expense of institutionalizing and perhaps perpetuating inferior decision making. Our preferred solution is to change the processes of corporate planning and budgeting to help improve the timeliness of managerial decisions; after all, good management is as much about making decisions at the right time as about making the right decisions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=2}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:2})

\emph{Nice discussion of why managers often don't take "optimal" options and how this changes option methodology (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"But in most cases, the value of the underlying asset is not so clear." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=3}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:3})

"But it is often unclear what the holder of a real option has the right to buy or how long that right will last" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=4}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:4})

"The elegant, Nobel Prize-winning Black-Scholes-Merton model, published in 1973, was designed to value an option that was exercisable only at the end of its life and whose underlying share paid no dividend" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=4}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:4})

"and attempts to use it for real-option valuation are misguided and inappropriate" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=4}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:4})

"In particular, work by John Cox, Steve Ross, and Mark Rubinstein has led to the creation of binomial, or lattice, models that are built around decision trees and are ideally suited to real-option valuation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=4}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:4})

"Managers suspect that the options approach routinely overvalues a company's growth opportunities" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=10}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:10})

"In our opinion, the real reason that real options sometimes turn out to be less valuable than predicted by models is that managers don't exercise their option rights in a timely and rational manner." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=10}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:10})

"The question of whether companies exercise their real options optimally has been much less comprehensively researched." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GWFPTIVA?page=11}{Copeland and Tufano 2004:11})},

"we show that the persistent jet stream patterns were, in the first place, due to an amplification of quasi-stationary waves with zonal wave numbers 6-8." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=1}{Coumou et al 2014:12331})

"the anomalous circulation regimes lead to persistent surface weather conditions and therefore to midlatitude synchronization of extreme heat and rainfall events on monthly timescales" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=1}{Coumou et al 2014:12331})

"Spectral analyses of observed wind fields show that, to a first order, synoptic waves with k equal to 6-8 (for which the stationary component is usually small) indeed follow the linear relationship given by Eq. 1." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=1}{Coumou et al 2014:12331})

"Thermally and orographically forced waves are quasistationary [as discussed in Petoukhov et al. (16)] and thus do not follow Eq. 1." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=2}{Coumou et al 2014:12332})

"From the thermal wind equation it follows that this implies a sharp poleward temperature gradient at 45\textdegree{}N and 70\textdegree{}N and weak gradients in between" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=2}{Coumou et al 2014:12332})

"Thus, in addition to a wave guide, also the right forcing pattern is critical for resonance to occur" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QEJCSAA4?page=2}{Coumou et al 2014:12332})},

"The SACZ is an elongated axis of clouds and precipitation, formed through convergent winds oriented in a northwest-southeast manner across southeast Brazil and over the southwest Atlantic Ocean.

"Two problems are barriers to planning and designing infrastructure systems that can be deployed as needed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=1}{de Neufville et al 2006:107})

"flexibility costs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=1}{de Neufville et al 2006:107})

"To endow the Tagus Bridge with the capacity for a second deck to carry trains should this ever be desired, the Portuguese government initially had to spend considerably more for steel, construction, access, etc. How can designers justify such costs analytically?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=1}{de Neufville et al 2006:107})

"It represents a "right, but not an obligation" to take some course of action\textemdash{}such as the construction of rail lines over the Tagus Bridge\textemdash{}that may be advisable either if there is some unfortunate turn of events or some new opportunities" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=1}{de Neufville et al 2006:107})

"Thus, even when practitioners are skilled in the use of the financial techniques for evaluating options, the results they produce are based on assumptions that are difficult to explain" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=2}{de Neufville et al 2006:108})

"The design that maximizes the NPV is the base case against which flexible solutions are compared, so as to derive the value of these alternative designs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=2}{de Neufville et al 2006:108})

"simulating possible scenarios. Each scenario leads to a different NPV, and the collection of scenarios provides both an "expected net present value"ENPV and the distribution of possible out-   comes for a project." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=2}{de Neufville et al 2006:108})

"The case assumes that doing so adds 5\% to the total initial construction cost." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=3}{de Neufville et al 2006:109})

"This is the "flaw of averages" or Jensen's inequalitySavage 2000  " (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=4}{de Neufville et al 2006:110})

"For this case, the decision to construct an extra floor or 200 spaces was made if the capacity was less than the demand for two consecutive years. Other criteria and rules could be programmed in." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RG6F4F74?page=4}{de Neufville et al 2006:110})

"Compared to alternative approaches that require advanced mathematics and financial concepts, and that focus narrowly on the expected value of an option and ignore the ways options change the distribution of outcomes, the spreadsheet approach is both much easier to use and more informative."

"although there are a growing number of studies indicating that other instructional approaches are more effective (1-8)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=1}{Deslauriers et al 2011:862})

"In our case, the deliberate practice takes the form of a series of challenging questions and tasks that require the students to practice physicistlike reasoning and problem solving during class time while provided with frequent feedback." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=1}{Deslauriers et al 2011:862})

"As the students work through these tasks, they receive feedback from fellow students (12) and from the instructor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=1}{Deslauriers et al 2011:862})

"preclass reading assignments, preclass reading quizzes, in-class clicker questions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=2}{Deslauriers et al 2011:863})

"active learning tasks (GT), and targeted in-class instructor feedback (IF)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=2}{Deslauriers et al 2011:863})

"A typical schedule for a class was the following: CQ1, 2 min; IF, 4 min; CQ2, 2 min; IF, 4 min; CQ2 (continued), 3 min; IF, 5 min; Revote CQ2, 1 min; CQ3, 3 min; IF, 6 min; GT1, 6 min; IF with a demonstration, 6 min; GT1 (continued), 4 min; and IF, 3 min" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YGZ5RCI9?page=2}{Deslauriers et al 2011:863})

  annotation = {"Robust performance analysis is a body of techniques concerned with\\
calculating the worst case performance (in our case, the value of a\\
mine) among all plausible probability models, such as those within\\
certain distance of a baseline model - namely, our extension of Brennan-\\
Schwartz - which is believed to be reasonably reflective of reality, while\\
being easy to compute or estimate. This can be challenging because it\\
gives rise to an infinite dimensional optimization problem. When the\\
distance is specified in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence (Kullback\\
and Leibler, 1951) (and other related notions, such as the Renyi divergence\\
(R\'enyi, 1961)), this optimization problem is often tractable,\\
and has been exploited in a range of literature in recent years, for example\\
in control theory (Iyengar, 2005; Padoan et al., 2010; Nilim and\\
El Ghaoui, 2005), distributionally robust optimization (Ben-Tal et al.,\\
2013), finance (Glasserman and Xu, 2014), economics (Hansen et al.,\\
2006; Hansen and Sargent, 2016) and queueing (Jain et al., 2010). In a\\
sense, the basic idea of this field is to posit as simplified a model of the\\
relevant phenomena as possible, and then come up with bounds of\\
valuations, over all possible models within a ``robustness bubble''\\
around the baseline model."},

"The resulting flood probability Pt is the probability that the water level will exceed the level of the dike, resulting in a flooding of the dike ring area." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TXHT98NF?page=3}{Eijgenraam et al 2012:3})

"When flooding occurs, the resulting water level in the dike ring is assumed to always reach as high as the lowest point of the dike above sea level. At this point the water runs over the dike back into the river or into another outlet. Of course, the height of the water level within the dike ring is one of the determinants of the amount of damage. If the dike is heightened, the resulting damage within the dike ring will increase. This is expressed in a simple exponential manner." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TXHT98NF?page=4}{Eijgenraam et al 2012:4})

"transparent methods to value investments in resilience and adaptation measures to protect physical assets from climate change impacts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=1}{Espinoza et al 2019:1})

"risk-adjusted discount rates introduces a pernicious time bias effect" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=1}{Espinoza et al 2019:1})

"Moreover, the effects of compounding and cascading hazards intensified under a changing climate (e.g., extreme rainfall events following a prolonged drought) could amplify the socioeconomic impact of such events (Vahedifard et al. 2016; AghaKouchak et al. 2018)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=2}{Espinoza et al 2019:2})

"Because insurance premiums are expressed in monetary terms, homeowners can easily assess the value of investing in a given safety feature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=2}{Espinoza et al 2019:2})

"A core consideration is the rate at which future benefits and costs are discounted to calculate the NPVof the investment with the discounting effect becoming more relevant as costs and benefits take place further into the future (Baum and Easterling 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=3}{Espinoza et al 2019:3})

"declining discount rate (DDR) concept for valuation of long-term safe investment projects with intraand intergenerational consequences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=4}{Espinoza et al 2019:4})

"At the heart of NPV techniques to evaluate risky investments is the selection of a discount rate ({$\alpha$}) that combines the time value of money (represented by the riskr) rp) free rate, and risk (represented by a risk premium, to convert future revenues (benefits) and costs to today's currency." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=5}{Espinoza et al 2019:5})

"Depending upon the magnitude of the risk adjustment, the analysis may artificially render long-term projects economically and financially unfeasible." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=5}{Espinoza et al 2019:5})

"Such an approach is the DNPV method introduced to value long-term infrastructure investments (Espinoza and Morris 2013; Espinoza 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=6}{Espinoza et al 2019:6})

"Tversky and Kahneman (1991) postulated that investors are loss averse (i.e., averse to wealth reduction) rather than risk averse (i.e., averse to variability of returns)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=6}{Espinoza et al 2019:6})

"it is the risk of the individual project that is important rather than its contribution to a hypothetical portfolio of projects" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=7}{Espinoza et al 2019:7})

"and this risk is accurately represented by a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) process with a 25\% volatility of the returns" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TBIJLY8Q?page=10}{Espinoza et al 2019:10})},

\emph{Extremely flattering portrait of Marito (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=4}{note on p.4})}

\emph{This seems a rather bad take; perhaps what is needed is instead a set of political reforms to increase participation of other parties? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=5}{note on p.5})}

\emph{Need to address tradeoffs between\\
- fishing\\
- navigation\\
- recreation\\
- urban flood control\\
- agricultural water demand (will come in the future if not now). There is no water policy at present. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=7}{note on p.7})}

\emph{At a minimum he ought to be ashamed of this legacy... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=7}{note on p.7})}

\emph{Nice take on Guarani (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=8}{note on p.8})}

\emph{This isn't about quality vs quantity, it's about farming vs ranching in the Chaco. But interesting! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=9}{note on p.9})}

\emph{It's not clear why this article is more "opinioney" than all the others (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{Asuncion has two flood problems. First, river floods are incredibly damaging. Second, there is minimal stormwater infrastructure and a massive paved marshy area which means even moderate rainfalls can cause serious traffic problems, damage homes, etc through pluvial flooding (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{No money for infrastructure (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{Nice article on deforestation. Glad to see FT giving it the appropriate attention. But would be helpful to connect the deforestation to local and regional environmental issues like heat waves, flood, etc (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{The marshy ground is not the main reason that there's not a metro. Light rail or BRT would also be extremely effective, but there just aren't any effective public services in the country. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{Yup! Showpiece {$>$} improving peoples' lives (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=10}{note on p.10})}

\emph{and used Andean people to do it (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WILHEEBR?page=11}{note on p.11})}},

"Water planners must ensure reliable, high-quality access to freshwater for domestic, agricultural, and industrial end-users while meeting financial and institutional constraints and preserving the sustainability of natural resources. Over-investment in infrastructure can lead to stranded assets worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars and unnecessary environmental impacts. Under-investment can lead to supply restrictions or outages with consequences for the economy, environment, and human health." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=16}{Fletcher 2018:16})

"However, in many regions of the world, population growth, economic growth, and urbanization are expected to have a greater impact on water scarcity than climate change [164]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=17}{Fletcher 2018:17})

\emph{to read: ref 164 (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=17}{note on p.17})}

"Three critical insights in this literature include: 1) explicit recognition of the limitations of forecasts and therefore the need to develop strategies that are relatively insensitive to forecasts; 2) the need for bottom-up vulnerability analysis, in which the conditions that lead to system failure are identified and evaluated, and 3) the potential for flexible or adaptive approaches to manage uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=18}{Fletcher 2018:18})

"Adaptive management can enable reliability at reduced cost by developing plans to ensure short-term water needs are met without investing in permanent solutions before the long-term future is well understood." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{Fletcher 2018:19})

"Defining "dynamic robustness" as flexibility enabling a plan to change in response to changing conditions over time, Walker et al. (2013) raises the limitations of RDM in developing dynamic robust solutions and highlights the value of DAPP in achieving dynamic robustness [165]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{Fletcher 2018:19})

\emph{Helpful to remember that the DAPP crowd and the RDM crowd are commercial competitors (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{note on p.19})}

~

"EOA focuses on exploring and weighing the various benefits and costs using uncertainty analysis rather than developing precise estimates of the value of flexible options [34]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{Fletcher 2018:19})

\emph{Interesting take on options analysis and deep uncertainty -- I'm not sure I agree but RDN knows what he's on about (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{note on p.19})}

~

"First, while the recent methods address-" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=19}{Fletcher 2018:19})

"ing deep uncertainty, such as RDM, have played an important role in acknowledging the limitations of probabilistic forecasts and developing planning approaches that are relatively insensitive to these limitations, many of the common uncertainties that impact water supply infrastructure planning can be treated probabilistically." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{Fletcher 2018:20})

\emph{Yes! Lots of uncertainties *can* be treated probabilistically (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{note on p.20})}

~

"is a focus on static rather than dynamic approaches to characterizing climate and hydrological uncertainty in infrastructure planning" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{Fletcher 2018:20})

"existing approaches do not provide a framework for evaluating the value of flexibility in managing hydrological uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{Fletcher 2018:20})

"While some recent approaches to water supply infrastructure sequencing include flexibility as an objective in a multi-criteria decision problem [12], these approaches do not provide a basis for assessing whether flexibility is a worthwhile objective" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{Fletcher 2018:20})

\emph{Hallelujah (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{note on p.20})}

"Flexibility is a life-cycle system property of an engineering system that can be useful in achieving performance goals, not a performance metric itself [35]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=20}{Fletcher 2018:20})

"multi-stage stochastic planning approach to develop policies for exercising flexible infrastructure options." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=21}{Fletcher 2018:21})

"Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are presented as stand-alone papers; while there is some overlap in literature review and methods across the chapters, this approach allows them to be read and used in isolation without reviewing the dissertation as a whole." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=23}{Fletcher 2018:23})

\emph{Can I do this too? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=23}{note on p.23})}

"Our framework for water supply infrastructure planning under multiple uncertainties comprises three main steps, illustrated in Figure 2-1. First, uncertainties are classified according to two dimensions: the level of uncertainty and learning potential." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=26}{Fletcher 2018:26})

"The nature of uncertainty refers to whether the uncertainty arises from natural stochastic variability or from a lack of information [166]. These two categories are often called aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, respectively" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=29}{Fletcher 2018:29})

"We define two categories along this dimension: high and low learning potential. Uncertainties with high learning potential are defined as those for which new observations can be collected, either presently or in the future as new observations become available, to reduce or update uncertainty in a way that meaningful impacts forecasts for decision-making. Low learning potential uncertainties are those which cannot be meaningfully updated, either because new information cannot be feasible collected or because the new information does not meaningfully change previous forecasts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=31}{Fletcher 2018:31})

\emph{This is a helpful framing -- and gets at what I have discussed with Manu w/r/t changing rate at which uncertainties resolve (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=31}{note on p.31})}

"We apply probabilistic approaches for statistical uncertainties and scenario-based approaches for deep uncertainties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV45NFYD?page=33}{Fletcher 2018:33})

"One approach is to build an optimization tool thatfinds the time-series of dike heightenings that minimizes the total economic cost of building dikes or levees (Eijgenraam et al., 2014; Kind, 2014; Slijkhuis et al., 1997; Speijker et al., 2000; Van Dantzig, 1956; van der Pol et al., 2014). To incorporate uncertainty, this process can be repeated over various sets of model parameters and the expectation of the total costs can be minimized" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=1}{Garner and Keller 2018:96})

"Second, insufficient sampling of uncertainty can under-represent extreme events that may weigh heavily in the decision (Garner et al., 2016; Lempert et al., 2004)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

"We use a states-of-the-world (SOWs) approach about SLR and storm surge to introduce uncertainty to the SLR adaptation model and provide coverage of tail-area events." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

"The objective is tofind the time series of annual dike heightenings ut that minimizes the total discounted social cost over the simulated time horizon of 300 years" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

"Both investment cost and the expectation of damages are discounted by a factor of {$\delta$} and {$\delta$} respectively 1" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

\emph{Sure, we can have different discounting for losses and investment costs -- think of it as insurance vs discount (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{note on p.97})}

~

"exponential" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

"Parameter values of the economic component of the base model." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

\emph{Parameter values (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{note on p.97})}

~

"The probability offlooding ( Pt) is handled differently in our formulations and is discussed in section 2.2." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

\emph{Good, although I might do things slightly differently (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{note on p.97})}

~

"Future mean annual sea-level rise is approximated by the approach used in Sriver et al. (2018)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

\emph{Should cite this paper for sea level rise model (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{note on p.97})}

~

"c* t* The linear rate would increase by when t exceeds in the simulation. The joint distribution of these parameters are estimated through the calibration process described in Oddo et al. (2017) and used in this analysis to derive SOWs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{Garner and Keller 2018:97})

\emph{Interesting -- (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=2}{note on p.97})}

~

"To represent a large portion of the tails of the distributions of this uncertainty, this analysis produces 100,000 SOWs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

\emph{Great, I will absolutely use this. Excellent! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{note on p.98})}

~

"Additionally, the probability of the water level t exceeding the dike height at time used in calculating the expected damages ( Pt in eq. (3)) is replaced with the proportion of SOWs with water levels that exceed the dike height at that time." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

"For example, a specific policy that is appropriate for a rapid increase in water height would unnecessarily heighten the dike if the water levels rise slowly or" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

"not at all. Conversely, a policy that is appropriately built for slow-rising water levels would be catastrophically underprepared if the water levels rise abruptly and quickly" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

"In other words, new observations provide information about the system that can be used in further decisions. This learning process is absent from the intertemporal approach, but can be included using Direct Policy Search (DPS) (Deisenroth et al., 2013; Giuliani et al., 2016; Quinn et al., 2017)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

\emph{OK, we need to look at the DPS approach as well -- this really looks to be a lot like policy gradient methods in RL and if the connections are made in the DPS papers then that's great; if not then making them here is a helpful connection (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{note on p.98})}

~

"A function then maps the state variable or variables to one or more signposts that trigger actions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

"Our analysis considers two state variables for the DPS formulation, the observed mean annual rate of change in the water level at the dike ( {$\beta$}t) and the square root of the sum of squared residuals ( srsst) between the observed water level andfitted water levels derived from a linear model regressed on the previous 30 simulation years of water level (mean annual SLR and surge) at time t." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

\emph{THIS is the piece that deep RL can dramatically improve upon! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{note on p.98})}

~

"Thefirst quantity is the buffer height, which defines the minimum distance between the water level and the top of the dike that is considered safe" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

\emph{I would do this differently as well! There should be some uncertainty about the LFV process -- this model doesn't consider that storms may be getting stronger, but many more cases are entirely feasible. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{note on p.98})}

~

"depends on the system state" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

"The state variables map to the buffer height and freeboard height through quadratic relationships" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{Garner and Keller 2018:98})

\emph{This is hokey! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=3}{note on p.98})}

~

"We demonstrate that a revised problem formulation that leverages and adapts to environmental observations can drastically reduce the total social costs of a coastal adaptation problem while increasing the robustness of the fortification to uncertain sea-level rise and storm surge. The DPS formulation, which adapts actions to an observed state of the system, can produce solutions with simultaneously lower expected investment costs and expected damages relative to a more traditional intertemporal approach in far fewer function evaluations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=6}{Garner and Keller 2018:101})

"The selection of state variables can be vital to the DPS approach. We derive the state variables used in our analysis from a relatively easy-toobserve quantity (maximum annual water level" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNMTYSR6?page=6}{Garner and Keller 2018:101})}

\emph{If it "feels wrong", it probably is -- just need to state formally why (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=25}{note on p.25})}

"it is difficult to contemplate strong frequency interpretations for the probabilities being referenced. Frequency interpretations can usually be constructed, however, and this is an extremely useful tool in statistics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=27}{Gelman et al 2014:27})

"so it seems reasonable to describe uncertainty in the language of random events" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=27}{Gelman et al 2014:27})

"In any case, however, certain elements requiring scientific judgment will remain, notably the choice of data included in the analysis, the parametric forms assumed for the distributions, and the ways in which the model is checked" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=28}{Gelman et al 2014:28})

"jittered" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=29}{Gelman et al 2014:29})

"but the distribution need not be realistically concentrated around the true value, because often the information about \texttheta{} contained in the data will far outweigh any reasonable prior probability specification." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=49}{Gelman et al 2014:49})

"this choice of prior density is conjugate" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=52}{Gelman et al 2014:52})

\emph{So the traditional approach here would be to do a hypothesis test. Gelman pretty clearly argues that that's not a good idea. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=52}{note on p.52})}

"Because of the large sample and the fact that the distribution of \texttheta{} is concentrated away from zero and one, the normal approximation works well in this example." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=52}{Gelman et al 2014:52})

\emph{heuristic for when normal approximation may work well (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=52}{note on p.52})}

"even when the normal distribution does not itself provide a good model fit, it can be useful as a component of a more complicated model involving t or finite mixture distributions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=54}{Gelman et al 2014:54})

"the posterior precision equals the prior precision plus the data precision." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQA7Z98W?page=55}{Gelman et al 2014:55})

"Lack of detection in observations is related to the small signal-to-noise ratio of forced circulation changes, reflecting the fact that climate variability is primarily a dynamical phenomenon [6]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUB6BWJY?page=2}{Grantham 2019:20190014})

"Ways must therefore be found to construct useful scientific information on the regional scale, and even on the local scale, that reflect an appropriate level of uncertainty yet retain the relevant information about climate risk" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUB6BWJY?page=2}{Grantham 2019:20190014})

"We first discuss the uncertainty arising from internal variability, since it is conceptually much easier to deal with." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUB6BWJY?page=5}{Grantham 2019:20190017})

"The uncertainty from internal variability is fundamentally irreducible (leaving aside the possibility of finite-time prediction from specified initial conditions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUB6BWJY?page=5}{Grantham 2019:20190017})

"Deser C, Terray L, Phillips AS. 2016 Forced and internal components of winter air temperature trends over North America during the past 50 years: mechanisms and implications. J. Clim. 29, 2237-2258. (doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0304.1)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IUB6BWJY?page=14}{Grantham 2019:20190026})

This looks to be broadly a good take. A few comments

\begin{itemize}

\item I dislike the use of Type I and Type II errors. It discretizies climate change and action into 0-1 boxes which is counter-productive and unrealistic. Andrew G has also written about these a lot

\item Ref 6 looks interesting

\item Ways must therefore be found to construct useful scientific information on the regional scale,and even on the local scale, that reflect an appropriate level of uncertainty yet retain the relevant ~information about climate risk -- agree completely

\item Discussion of epistemic vs aleatory uncertainty is like ours of informational vs intrinsic uncertainty. Interesting that the notion of making finite-time predictions is treated as a tangent -- I get that it's not helpful in estimating response to climate forcing, but this can inform a lot of adaptation decisions

\item Point: the notion of "error" is not well-defined -- agreed and this is why it's easy to show that when you change your model, some measure of some variable gets better somewhere, which has led to a pollution of the literature by zillions of modeling studies showing precisely this

\item Point: we should investigate only scenarios -- what will happen *if we do X*. I'm not sure I entirely agree here. On the one hand, these are the right questions to ask scientifically. On the other hand, the question of what constitutes a "plausible future" and what does not is messy. Sometimes what decision-makers need (at least on the adaptation side) is probabilistic information and markers that will indicate which trajectory you are on as you go along. This scenario focus is most relevant for making political arguments about the value of mitigation

\item Adam has been taking a class with Dave Blei on causal learning and networks and is extremely skeptical about the ways they are often used in climate science. I say this as someone who likes to use a network to model things I care about, but understanding the limitations is really important

\item Moving from p-values to Bayes Factors doesn't address the real problems with p-values (see various Gelman rants), particularly the strong dependence on your choices of model and null hypothesis

\item He calls for "the reframing of the risk question from the prediction space to the decision space" -- I very strongly agree with this -- but doesn't actually make any very useful suggestions for how to do this.

"Robustness in this context broadly refers to " the insensitivity of system design to errors, random or otherwise, in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice" (Matalas and Fiering 1977), although specific mathematical implementations of this concept differ dramatically" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=1}{Herman et al 2015:4015012})

\emph{It's worth at least engaging with these ideas (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=1}{note on p.4015012})}

~

"The term a posteriori decision support is drawn from the multiobjective optimization literature, referring to the generation of decision alternatives through computational search before imposing stakeholder preference on the problem (Cohon and Marks 1973, 1975), also known as generate-first-choose-later (GFCL) in the systems engineering literature (e.g., Hwang et al. 1979; Crossley et al. 1999; Balling and Richard 2000; Messac and Mattson 2002; Reynoso-Meza et al. 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=1}{Herman et al 2015:4015012})

"single decision alternative produced by weighted aggregation, while promising in the projected future, may fail under deviations from this projection. A multiobjective, a posteriori approach provides a flexible set of alternatives that may be evaluated according to their robustness." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=1}{Herman et al 2015:4015012})

\emph{I don't buy the argument that multi-objective optimization solves the robustness problem. It may have uses, but they're fundamentally different. It's also tough to think about how you would do something like real options -- or any sequential planning -- with multi-objective planning. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=1}{note on p.4015012})}

~

"[e.g., climate change scenarios guiding the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Moss et al. 2010; IPCC 2013)]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

\emph{We should stop misinterpreting IPCC scenarios... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{note on p.4015013})}

~

"In the former case, expected value often fails to adequately capture stakeholder preferences under uncertainty" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

\emph{But if your utility function models this explicitly, you should be good! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{note on p.4015013})}

~

"the distributions themselves are uncertain, a condition known as deep or Knightian uncertainty (Knight 1921; Langlois and Cosgel 1993; Lempert 2002; Lempert et al. 2003; Polasky et al. 2011; Kasprzyk et al. 2013; Dessai et al. 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

"" wicked problem" (Rittel and Webber 1973; Liebman 1976; Reed and Kasprzyk 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

"it is possible to generate plausible states of the world and potentially rank them in order of likelihood following additional analysis (Kwakkel and Pruyt 2013). However, we would prefer to do so a posteriori, after identifying the most vulnerable states of the world for which likelihoods should be derived. This scenario-neutral (Prudhomme et al. 2010) or bottom-up approach (Weaver et al. 2013; Nazemi and Wheater 2014) has been advocated by several recent frameworks for decision making under uncertainty, including Decision Scaling (Brown et al. 2012), Robust Decision Making (RDM) (Lempert 2002; Lempert et al. 2003), Information-Gap (Info-Gap) (Ben-Haim 2004), and Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM) (Kasprzyk et al. 2013). The components of these frameworks will be compared in the following section, along with the extent to which they align with the concepts of a posteriori decision support." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

\emph{Useful literature review. I still advocate a ban on new frameworks or names... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{note on p.4015013})}

~

"In this work, we caution against a priori assumptions throughout the analysis: the prespecification of alternatives, preference weighting, the most important (sensitive) factors, or performance thresholds may produce unintended consequences for decision making." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

\emph{This is a really good maxim -- but I think that in general it's hard to do this, and we should be wary of making implicit assumptions in order to avoid making explicit ones. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{note on p.4015013})}

~

"Alternatives to be optimized may include binary infrastructure decisions (Matrosov et al. 2013b), continuous variables such as decision triggers or transfer allocations (Zeff et al. 2014), functions mapping observed states to actions (Giuliani et al. 2014), or a combination thereof." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

"Similarly, McInerney et al. (2012) optimize a weighted sum of the expected and worst-case outcomes, whereas Hamarat et al. (2014) propose an approach for optimizing robustness according to a signal-to-noise ratio, which reflects the ratio of the mean performance divided by its standard deviation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{Herman et al 2015:4015013})

\emph{These are goofy approximations... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=2}{note on p.4015013})}

~

"robustness frameworks typically proceed by evaluating their performance across a set of uncertain states of the world" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=3}{Herman et al 2015:4015014})

"This sampling is typically performed over noninformative priors, reflecting the exploratory nature of deep uncertainty analyses; however, a wellcharacterized probability distribution can be used if known." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=3}{Herman et al 2015:4015014})

"a larger risk lies in sampling too narrow a range (thus ignoring potentially important vulnerabilities) rather than too wide a range which, at worst, will sample extreme states of the world in which all alternatives fail" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{Herman et al 2015:4015015})

\emph{Good point here -- can cite (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{note on p.4015015})}

~

"Broadly, regret quantifies the cost (not necessarily monetary) of choosing incorrectly" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{Herman et al 2015:4015015})

\emph{I really really dislike the regret framing, though, because it ignores the pathways idea and makes comparisons that aren't really relevant. It's worth developing this point a bit, this is still vague. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{note on p.4015015})}

~

"In practice, this is done by calculating the fraction of sampled states of the world in which a solution satisfies one or more performance thresholds, as done by Herman et al. (2014)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{Herman et al 2015:4015015})

\emph{Again, though -- you should be able to put these performance thresholds into your utility function, effectively as soft constraints. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=4}{note on p.4015015})}

~

"using the climate response function (e.g., Brown et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{Herman et al 2015:4015016})

\emph{As pointed out earlier -- what is missing from this is identification of the relevant climate variables (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{note on p.4015016})}

~

"Recent studies have called for sensitivity analysis to become a required tool to improve the transparency of model assumptions in policy contexts (Borgonovo and Peccati 2008; Saltelli and Funtowicz 2013; Saltelli et al. 2013), an apt recommendation for water systems planning problems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{Herman et al 2015:4015016})

\emph{This seems useful to me... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{note on p.4015016})}

~

"The financial variability caused by these drought mitigation measures may prove extremely disruptive to utilities who rely on stable revenues for cost recovery on capitalintensive infrastructure investments (Hughes and Leurig 2013; Hughes and Royster 2014)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{Herman et al 2015:4015016})

"F\dh{}x\TH{} optimize a vector of four objectives" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{Herman et al 2015:4015016})

\emph{This seems really odd, though. First of all, "worst-case" is odd because you need to consider probabilities -- there is a probability p{$>$}0 for which Godzilla stomps your city but why plan for that. Instead, you want a utility function that considers both the expectation and the spread of your costs. I guess I understand that you might want to compute first rather than to define your lambda parameter a priori, but... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=5}{note on p.4015016})}

~

"The decision variables xu for utility u are" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{Herman et al 2015:4015017})

\emph{I think the challenge that we end up with here is that it's really hard to do any sort of sequential planning in this framework. Being simultaneously sequential and multi-dimensional while preserving the maxim of avoiding any hard assumptions will just leave the decision-maker with zillions of knobs to tweak which become ever less interpretable. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{note on p.4015017})}

~

"we define R1 for each decision alternative as the 90th percentile deviation from the baseline, maximized over all objectives" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{Herman et al 2015:4015017})

\emph{Define R1 (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{note on p.4015017})}

"measure R2 calculates regret as the deviation from the best solution in each state of the wor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{Herman et al 2015:4015017})

\emph{Define R2 (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{note on p.4015017})}

"Measure S1 is defined as the fraction of N states of the world in which a solution meets stakeholders' performance requirements in one or more objectives" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{Herman et al 2015:4015017})

\emph{Measure S1 (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=6}{note on p.4015017})}

"Finally, measure S2 represents the uncertainty horizon that can be withstood prior to system failure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{Herman et al 2015:4015018})

\emph{Measure S2 -- this is really goofy because actually our uncertainties about different pieces of the puzzle may have very different structure (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{note on p.4015018})}

~

"utilities' reliability requirement to com- \textonequarter{} pute S2 (i.e., a univariate value of r 0.99)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{Herman et al 2015:4015018})

"13 dimensions of deep uncertainty including climatic and economic factors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{Herman et al 2015:4015018})

"In this study, the failure outcome that we analyze is the violation of any of the following conditions: reliability {$<$}97\%, restriction frequency{$>$}33\%, or worst-case cost{$>$}10\%." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{Herman et al 2015:4015018})

\emph{Even though the stated reason for doing multi-objective stuff was to avoid making any assumptions about our preferences, we have now made assumptions including\\
- these things highlighted\\
- we care about worst-case scenario and not everything else\\
- probabilities about how likely future scenarios are\\
- we have defined 13 dimensions of uncertainty which weren't even specified (probably are in Zeff 14?) \\
now, the article states that they're developed via stakeholder elicitation but the point is that you can't actually get away from baking some preferences into your model, and so you might as well be really explicit about it rather than pretending that your multi-objective optimization solves this for you. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=7}{note on p.4015018})}

~

"Fig. 7 indicates that the four different robustness measures may lead decision makers to very different regions of the objective space, with some of these differences caused by mathematical artifacts rather than system properties." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=9}{Herman et al 2015:4015020})

\emph{Perhaps, but also part of the problem is that your robustness measures are really goofy. Still, this is a good point to CITE. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=9}{note on p.4015020})}

~

"Individual compared with multivariate performance requirements" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=10}{Herman et al 2015:4015021})

\emph{I'm all for plotting different measures at the end so we can visualize our different scenarios, but that's very different from treating them as objectives to maximize. We can visualize things that aren't dimensions of our objective phase space. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JA4QU84L?page=10}{note on p.4015021})}

"When formulating a sequential decision problem, it is important to specify the criteria by which decision makers at decision points" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=2}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017006})

"in the future (i.e., beyond the first decision point) will make their decisions. Typically, decision makers at these future points will consider past investments to be " sunk costs" and will make decisions according to the costs and benefits of the options they have at their disposal at that point, looking forward" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=2}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017006})

"here it is assumed that at the future decision point decision makers will optimize their decision based on cost-benefit criteria." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=2}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017006})

"By incorporating two layers of flexibility for the real option (timing and protection level of subsequent decisions), the option value is more fully captured" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=2}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017006})

"The optimal protection level was sensitive to the climate change scenario, but not to the socioeconomic scenario. This was because the socioeconomic scenario influenced both the total risk (without protection) and the residual risk (with protection) by roughly the same amount" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=6}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017010})

"\textonequarter{} At t 0, a specific protection level was selected in the context of uncertain future changes. For Phase 2 the uncertainty regarding the future was assumed to be resolved so the final protection level was optimized to suit the known future" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=6}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017010})

"The adaptive Phase 2 could \textonequarter{} take place at t 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=6}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017010})

"in other words, building in flexibility helps to make the performance of the system relatively insensitive to the initial design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=11}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017015})

"The benefit-cost ratio of the fixed design is much more sensitive than the flexible design to the climate change / socioeconomic scenario that actually materializes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=11}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017015})

"A methodology for evaluating the benefits of forgoing development and setting aside land that may be occupied by a flood protection in future is also demonstrated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/534I4JJ4?page=11}{Hino and Hall 2017:4017015})

"Alternatively, it could be viewed as an amplified stationary Rossby wave pattern from the eastern N Pacific to Europe. Otherwise, the focus could be on the block that is developing over Europe." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=1}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:115})

"the baroclinic nature of the forced response as compared to the equivalent barotropic natural variability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=2}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:116})

"Suppose the dominant mode of jet variability represents meridional jet shifts, as is often the case" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=2}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:116})

"Concerning blocking, a consensus is emerging of a general decrease in blocking occurrence under climate change." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=2}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:116})

"These considerations suggest that blocking is responding somewhat passively to the changes in the largescale circulation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=3}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:117})

"Hassanzadeh et al. [50] have led the field in this area with simple dynamical model experiments showing a reduction in wave amplitude as the meridional temperature gradient weakens, in contrast to the Francis and Vavrus hypothesis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=3}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:117})

"A 5 \% decrease in zonal flow would therefore lead to a 2\textonehalf\% increase in the stationary wavenumber and decrease in the stationary wavelength" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=4}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:118})

"In summary, for decreased baroclinicity and zonal wind as a simple result of Arctic amplification, the arguments suggest the following:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"For Rossby waves forced by orography, the same streamline amplitude but decreased temperature anomaly (\textasciitilde{}B) \& For Rossby waves forced by the same midlatitude heating, B-1\=u- 1/ 2) a much increased streamline amplitude (\textasciitilde{} and \=u- 1/ 2) slightly increased temperature perturbation (\textasciitilde{}" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"growth rates decreasing with B" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"One considers a latitude circle and the planetary waves around it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"Rossby waves with propagation along tracks that curve westwards in or out of the tropics and with guiding in strong westerly jets in the higher latitudes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"however, Rossby waves are triggered much more readily by lower-latitude deep convection rather than by higher-latitude boundary layer processes [77]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=5}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:119})

"Petoukhov et al. [79] and Coumou et al. [80] is that extreme seasons can be associated with large-amplitude anomalous wave-like structures which extend around the hemisphere." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=6}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:120})

"79], it is actually the sharpness of the tropical side of the subtropical jet that was crucial to produce a waveguide between about 35\textdegree{} and 47\textdegree{}N. Perhaps, tropical broadening could be important in this regard" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=6}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:120})

"no clear picture of changes in weather and climate extremes has yet emerged, and it is to be hoped that future research, based on physical and theoretical arguments and on observed and modelled data" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TEJV7H6Q?page=8}{Hoskins and Woollings 2015:122})},

However, I really don't like scenario analysis much because you're not exploring the full range of posterior probabilities. I think scenario analysis can be a useful tool for communication and for checking your analysis to ensure it makes sense (like a case study for a method) but it shouldn't be your central source of evaluation. In particular, it encourages the "false positive" and "yes/no stationarity" mindset which isn't helpful for framing the problem. I'm also not a big fan of the concept of "regret" but OK.

"Decision levers are used to construct the city's portfolio of three water supply instruments: permanent rights, spot leases, and options. Permanent rights are a non-market based instrument in which the city is allocated a percentage of reservoir inflow in each month, using a ratio of the volume of the city's rights (the decision lever, NR) to the total volume of regional rights." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJTPXM9Y?page=6}{Kasprzyk et al 2013:60})

"An adaptive options contract reduces lease price volatility by guaranteeing afixed price for water acquisitions made later in the year." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJTPXM9Y?page=6}{Kasprzyk et al 2013:60})

"Acquisitions of water from both leases and options are controlled by anticipatory thresholds that relate expected supply to demand." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MJTPXM9Y?page=6}{Kasprzyk et al 2013:60})

This is one of many examples of what people are doing. There is clearly some thought in it, but a lot of the specific choices don't make sense. Why are there so many objectives? Why can't they be combined? How can an analysis with so many arbitrary choices really involve a "compute first choose later" framework that postpones assumptions?}

"Cross-spectrum analysis based on linear correlations in the time domain suggested a coupling between large river flows and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=1}{Khan et al 2006:24})

"The monthly discharge data" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=1}{Khan et al 2006:24})

\emph{Interesting -- perhaps this DJF flooding was due to a more Parana-like behavior? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=2}{note on p.25})}

"The Parana River discharge data for the period \textdegree{} 1904-1997 was collected monthly at Corrientes (lat. 27 S, \textdegree{} long. 59 W) located downstream of the confluence of the Paraguay and the Parana rivers. The seasonal cycle of the Parana exhibits a single peak in February with a long recession and low discharge in September (Figure S1b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=2}{Khan et al 2006:25})

"The MI values range from 0 (independent) to1 (completely dependent). For a bivariate normal set (X, Y), r, the MI and the linear CC, denoted by are related as r( 2 I(X; Y) =0.5 log[1 X, Y) ] [Joe, 1989]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=2}{Khan et al 2006:25})

\emph{this is good since stage and PDO are roughly  normal (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=2}{note on p.25})}

"Nonlinear CCs obtained from these methods are compared with linear and theoretical CCs using linear, nonlinear, and periodic functions," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=3}{Khan et al 2006:26})

"the presence of noise typically leads to an under-estimation of the true MI between the underlying nonlinear signals (see Text S1, section 3)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=4}{Khan et al 2006:27})

"the seasonal cycle for a particular year consists of 12 months starting with the month having the lowest average discharge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=4}{Khan et al 2006:27})

"Paran" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5A7ZGA8J?page=5}{Khan et al 2006:28})

"physically-based groundwater model for the entire Indus Plain aquifer underlying Punjab province is developed, which accounts for 90\% of total groundwater pumping in Pakistan, and simulates future conditions under various policy and climate scenarios." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=1}{Khan et al 2017:5016014})

"Over 70\% of land in Pakistan is irrigated using groundwater in conjunction with surface water supplies (Qureshi et al. 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=1}{Khan et al 2017:5016014})

"as semiarid to arid, with the aridity increasing toward the south." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=3}{Khan et al 2017:5016016})

"These studies characterize this aquifer as unconfined and connected hydrologically across Punjab" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=3}{Khan et al 2017:5016016})

"Groundwater abstraction forms the biggest flux out of the aquifer, but there exists significant uncertainty in both total abstraction and the spatial variation in groundwater pumping across Punjab." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=3}{Khan et al 2017:5016016})

"Overall, a good agreement between the observed and calibrated aquifer parameters was observed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=4}{Khan et al 2017:5016017})

"Seepage from the irrigation canals across Punjab has been identified as a major component of the total recharge into the aquifer." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=5}{Khan et al 2017:5016018})

\emph{Perhaps focus should be on reducing evaporation? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=5}{note on p.5016018})}

"biggest sources of uncertainty in building this provincewide groundwater model was estimation of groundwater pumping in Punjab, which has considerable variation, both spatially and temporally." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=8}{Khan et al 2017:5016021})

"A reallocation of the water supplies would be useful in not only mitigating groundwater depletion and waterlogging, but also reducing the inequities that exist within the system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/78VPUIG9?page=9}{Khan et al 2017:5016022})},

"3.3. Decision Tree and Decision Rules" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3J2FIX6N?page=8}{Kind et al 2018:83})

"At each time moment in the scenario tree, a decision can be taken to increase the dikes, to implement a room for the river measure, or to do nothing" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3J2FIX6N?page=8}{Kind et al 2018:83})

"Real options analysis can help to design and evaluate robust and flexible strategies in order to increase the efficiency of investments" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3J2FIX6N?page=17}{Kind et al 2018:92})

"It is complex, data demanding, requires uncertainties to be recognized and quantified, and needs subjective choices and expert opinion." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3J2FIX6N?page=17}{Kind et al 2018:92})

This is quite good, but they're not hitting the climate dynamics. It would be really interesting to re-visit this case study with some slightly better estimation models and/or the robust real options framework [which I still need to read]. Their thinking is in the right direction but there is a *lot* more that one can do with this analysis.},

"three interactions: the response of the climate system to external forcing from anthropogenic and natural influences; interactions within and between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and cryosphere; and interaction between externally forced and internally generated variability, for example, during volcanic eruptions and variations of solar flux." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZQWCFY?page=1}{Kushnir et al 2019:1})

\emph{three sources of climate variability (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZQWCFY?page=1}{note on p.1})}

"The primary goal of near-term climate prediction (NTCP), by contrast, is to produce a skilful and reliable forecast of the actual evolution of both externally forced and internally generated components of the climate system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZQWCFY?page=1}{Kushnir et al 2019:1})

"NTCP depends on the ability of our coupled climate models to capture the predictable evolution of those climate system components that are represented in the initial conditions and respond realistically to the prescribed external forcing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZQWCFY?page=2}{Kushnir et al 2019:2})

\emph{What NTCP needs to succeed (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZQWCFY?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the set of most promising pathways." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=1}{Kwakkel et al 2015:373})

"However, if the future turns out to be different from the hypothesized futures, the plan is likely to fail." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=2}{Kwakkel et al 2015:374})

"Central to this paradigm is that the idea of finding a static optimal plan is replaced by finding a dynamically robust plan" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=2}{Kwakkel et al 2015:374})

\emph{Dynamically optimal! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=2}{note on p.374})}

"Analyzing climate adaptation in this way results in the'curse of dimensionality' and is severely limited in practice by the necessary computational burden (Webster et al. 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=2}{Kwakkel et al 2015:374})

"An adaptation tipping point is the condition under which a given policy action no longer meets its objectives" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=3}{Kwakkel et al 2015:375})

\emph{I'm not sure that I agree with this and I don't believe in constraints (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=4}{note on p.376})}

"In a recent paper, Kasprzyk et al. (2013) present an approach that is very similar in spirit" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=4}{Kwakkel et al 2015:376})

\emph{I don't think there's a reason to avoid combining models to make probabilistic projections, I dislike how the Lempert papers choose the worst model for each condition (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=4}{note on p.376})}

"structured way, one can explore and analyze the implications of the various alternative assumptions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=5}{Kwakkel et al 2015:377})

"In contrast, in the multi-objective case, one aims at making the trade-offs among the different objectives explicit through the identification of the set of non-dominated solutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=5}{Kwakkel et al 2015:377})

\emph{I think this misses the ways that we can use money to combine different solutions! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=5}{note on p.377})}

"Evolutionary algorithms use a population of solutions. This population can be evolved in such a way that it maintains diversity, while continually moving towards the Pareto frontier" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=5}{Kwakkel et al 2015:377})

"In order to govern the activation of the next action on a pathway, we use a simple rule-based system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8LX8UIHF?page=6}{Kwakkel et al 2015:378})

"potential nonlinear or threshold responses where both the triggering level and subsequent system response are poorly understood" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=1}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1009})

"uncertainty\textemdash{}optimal expected utility, the precautionary principle, and three different approaches to robust decision making" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=1}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1009})

"By deeply uncertain, we mean the condition where decisionmakers do not know or cannot agree upon the system model relating actions to consequences or the prior probabilities on key parameters of the system model (Lempert, Popper, \& Bankes, 2003; henceforth LPB)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1010})

\emph{Hmmm. Let's revisit this. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{note on p.1010})}

"The results of the example used here suggest that these robust decision approaches\textemdash{}trading some optimal performance for less sensitivity to assumptions, satisficing over a wide range of futures, and keeping options open\textemdash{}identify similar strategies as the most robust choice given similar assumptions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1010})

\emph{"But at heart, this optimum expected\\
utility framework views risks as characterized by a single probability distribution over future states of\\
the world, estimated prior to any choice of actions the citizens might take to address these risks." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{note on p.1010})}

"But at heart, this optimum expected utility framework views risks as characterized by a single probability distribution over future states of the world, estimated prior to any choice of actions the citizens might take to address these risks." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1010})

"threshold. They may worry that the single consensus joint probability distribution required for an expected utility analysis may leave behind potentially important information and suggest choices that erode system resilience (Rayner, 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=2}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1010})

"The precautionary principle takes many forms, but the key concept is that decisionmakers should take steps to prevent future harms even, and especially, when the causal chain between action and outcome is unclear and the likelihood of these outcomes uncertain." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1011})

\emph{NB this is quite different from the Taleb definition, but OK (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{note on p.1011})}

"because it provides no way to balance among competing goals (Sunstein, 2005)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1011})

"different than those of optimum expected utility theory when faced with poorly characterized probabilities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1011})

\emph{Or do they just estimate things in a strange way? Or is your utility function wrong? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{note on p.1011})}

"a range of different pdfs. Increasingly, ensembles of different distributions (Epstein \& Wang, 1994) and models (Krishnamurti et al., 1999) are used to improve predictions and represent uncertainty about uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1011})

\emph{This is just a mixture distribution, which is still a single PDF. Alternately, you can just have a single distribution with known hyper-parameters, so that you can still have uncertainty in the PDF of your quantity of interest. Weak logic here. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=3}{note on p.1011})}

"Robust approaches often require significantly more computational resources" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=4}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1012})

\emph{Then perhaps you are computing the expected utility wrong?! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=4}{note on p.1012})}

"Using a convenient Kalman filter representation for the learning," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=5}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1013})

\emph{I love simple models, but it seems here that all results are totally dependent on this assumption which doesn't really have an analog -- for example in water management you might start out with 30 years of data plus some understanding of the laws of physics? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=5}{note on p.1013})}

"small amount of optimal performance for less sensitivity to broken assumptions. It is similar to concepts of robustness employed in Ben-Haim's (2001) "Information-Gap" approach" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=9}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1017})

"The expected regret of strategy s contingent on distribution i is given b" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=10}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1018})

"regret is the difference between the strategy's present value expected utility (Equation (9)) in any state of the world and the expected utility of the optimum strategy in that state of the world." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=10}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1018})

\emph{Regret is such an odd concept -- just utility, but normalized (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=10}{note on p.1018})}

"That is, compared to the optimal strategy a robust strategy will have a smaller value of the weighted average of the best and worst expected regret," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=10}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1018})

\emph{This goofiness offets the thoughtful arguments expressed in the introduction... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=10}{note on p.1018})}

"satisficing criterion (Simon, 1959) and is similar to a domain criterion (Schneller \& Sphicas, 1983), where decisionmakers seek to reduce the interval over which a strategy performs poorly" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=12}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1020})

"The town's citizens could measure open options by the extent to which they can obtain high utility from their la" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1023})

\emph{Then you're just changing the utility function! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{note on p.1023})}

"The first approach seems most appropriate when decisionmakers begin with an initial prior probability distribution over future states of the world significantly different than a uniform, noninformative prior while the second and third begin closer to an initially equal weighting among plausible states" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1023})

\emph{It's definitely worth arguing that equal weightings are foolish since you either (a) are dominated by unlikely cases, or (b) refuse to consider any unlikely cases. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{note on p.1023})}

"Any less confidence in their uncertainty characterization and the citizens should adopt a robust rather than an optimum approach" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{Lempert and Collins 2007:1023})

\emph{I think the key point to make here is that all of these strategies for making "robust" decisions which are "insensitive to your assumptions" are in fact strong mathematical assumptions, which are merely hidden from the user;  in fact, better use of wide priors might more transparently highlight your uncertainty. Gelman and team have some nice examples on setting uninformative priors as well. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F79NZNGB?page=15}{note on p.1023})}},

"von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility model, which is the workhorse of modern economic" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=1}{Levin 2006:1})

"Savage's (1954) approach to choice under uncertainty, which rather than assuming the existence of objective probabilities attached to uncertain prospects" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=1}{Levin 2006:1})

"makes assumptions about choice behavior and argues that if these assumptions are satisfied, a decision-maker must act as if she is maximizing expected utility with respect to some subjectively held probabilities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=2}{Levin 2006:2})

"John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern (1944) in their book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=2}{Levin 2006:2})

\emph{von Neumann and Morgenstern: theory of games and economic behavior (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=2}{note on p.2})}

"we'll maintain the assumption that is afinite set. X" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=4}{Levin 2006:4})

"by a utility function R, where p0 if and only if U : P \textrightarrow{} p \textordmasculine{} U(p) {$\geq$} p0). U(" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=5}{Levin 2006:5})

\emph{nice way to note the utility function (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=5}{note on p.5})}

"Harsanyi (1955)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=11}{Levin 2006:11})

\emph{Justification for utilitarianism -- and that you can define a social welfare function as the weighted sum of each individual's utility (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=11}{note on p.11})}

"One should imagine being placed with equal probability in the position of any individual in society, and evaluate social alternatives from that viewpoint. If one's preferences regarding social policies from this position of uncertainty follow the vN-M axioms, this leads one to the utilitarian approach" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{Levin 2006:12})

\emph{This is a really neat take on the "veil of ignorance". (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{note on p.12})}

"dF(x)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{Levin 2006:12})

\emph{dF(x)=f(x)dx (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{note on p.12})}

"Bernoulli utility function and as the von NeumannU Morgenstern utility function" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{Levin 2006:12})

\emph{We should clarify that we use U as a von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function (as opposed to a Bernoulli one). (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=12}{note on p.12})}

"(Pratt, 1964)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=14}{Levin 2006:14})

\emph{Pratt 1964: take on risk preferences (called Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion) implies decreasing risk aversion with wealth (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=14}{note on p.14})}

"a risk-neutral investor cares only about the expected rate of return" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=23}{Levin 2006:23})

\emph{so a risk-neutral investor has a NM utility function equal to the Bernoulli one? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=23}{note on p.23})}

"if insurance prices are above their actuarily fair levels, a risk-averse agent will not fully insure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=24}{Levin 2006:24})

\emph{"Deep" uncertainty and NM utility function (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=27}{note on p.27})}

"it turns out that if my preferences over acts satisfy a set of properties somewhat similar in spirit to the vNM axioms (i.e. completeness, transitivity, something like continuity, the sure thing principle, and two axioms that have something of theflavor of substitution), then despite the lack of objective probabilities (and modulo some non-trivial technical issues), I must choose among acts as if I had in mind a probability distribution R+ over all the states of the world, and a utility function R p : S \textrightarrow{} u : X \textrightarrow{} mapping consequences into utils" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=27}{Levin 2006:27})

\emph{if preferences satisfy a set of properties similar to VN-M axioms then you must choose among decisions as if I had in mind a probability distribution and utility function mapping consequences into utils (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=27}{note on p.27})}

"due to Savage (1954)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=27}{Levin 2006:27})

"Savage's theorem doesn't assume the existence of probabilities. Instead it derives them from preferences over acts. So it provides a justification for expected utility analysis even in situations where the uncertainty isn't sharply and objectively delineated" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=28}{Levin 2006:28})

"Savage cautioned that for this reason the theory was really intended for "small worlds"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=28}{Levin 2006:28})

\emph{caveat about deep uncertainty in the Savage 1954 theory (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VYU5WN48?page=28}{note on p.28})}

"Existing climate/weather models do not appear to provide accurate long range forecasts for precipitation and temperature in the regio" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=2}{Lima and Lall 2016:2})

"Replacement electricity needs to be purchased from Argentina, or generated through thermal sources at a much higher cost" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{Lima and Lall 2016:6})

\emph{Replacement electricity is expensive -- cost cannot vary too much (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{note on p.6})}

"stable electricity tariffs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{Lima and Lall 2016:6})

"Drought conditions lead to a reduced inflow into the hydropower plants and the need to use more expensive energy sources (e.g. thermal and imported energy) to meet the demand, which imposes a financial risk to UTE, particularly when oil and gas prices are high." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{Lima and Lall 2016:6})

"there is a weather and oil price insurance transaction intermediated by World Bank Treasury to protect UTE against fiscal deficit and higher energy in the case of droughts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{Lima and Lall 2016:6})

\emph{Ah, we could consider adding this to our model. Super interesting. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{note on p.6})}

"The optimization considers the expected cash flows of the system, and" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=6}{Lima and Lall 2016:6})

"FOI" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=8}{Lima and Lall 2016:8})

\emph{1) they are going by 4 quarters of the year\\
2) they are just doing cost-benefit analysis -- need to look at what the benefits are but costs are clear (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=8}{note on p.8})}

"5 accounts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=20}{Lima and Lall 2016:20})

\emph{we can neglect these accounts as well (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=20}{note on p.20})}

"IEA High, Low, Median and Mean forecasts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=27}{Lima and Lall 2016:27})

\emph{OK, we can look up IEA forecasts (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=27}{note on p.27})}

"k-nn Moving block bootstrap applied directly to the UPHEI indices" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=29}{Lima and Lall 2016:29})

\emph{Ask Carlos if this is written up in a paper (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=29}{note on p.29})}

"An alternative to the knn moving block bootstrap, that would allow an extrapolation of the historical record is the use of a Hidden Markov Model, which also allows regime dynamics in the underlying variables and can be estimated using Bayesian methods, thus providing a comprehensive approach to model and parameter uncertainty for the simulations" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/M8UZYJ6E?page=31}{Lima and Lall 2016:31})}

"dynamic meteorology, with its many differential equations, even though differential-equation theory was not the branch of mathematics which had formerly appealed to me the most." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=1}{Lorenz 1984:98})

"but in meteorology these estimates are often the final products." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=2}{Lorenz 1984:99})

"Meteorological models difTer from these in that their equations are generally simplifications of basic physical laws." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=2}{Lorenz 1984:99})

"sic To a considerable extent the adoption of models in meteorology represents only a change in attitude" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=2}{Lorenz 1984:99})

"Inevitably this suppresses most of the finer structure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=2}{Lorenz 1984:99})

"low-order models, where the number of equations has been reduced below 100 or even below ten," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=3}{Lorenz 1984:100})

"dynamical systems" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=3}{Lorenz 1984:100})

"When a dynamical system is an atmospheric model, the points on the attractor represent those states which are compatible with the climate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=3}{Lorenz 1984:100})

"Such an approach can yield only partial explanations, but attempts to deal with all scales at once often yield nothing at all." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=3}{Lorenz 1984:100})

"of a chain of superposed large-scale eddies" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=5}{Lorenz 1984:102})

"The variables have been scaled so that the coefficients are unity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=5}{Lorenz 1984:102})

"t F are and G the values to which X andY would be driven if the westerly current and the eddies were not coupled." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=5}{Lorenz 1984:102})

"Certainly it cannot yield much quantitative information" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=5}{Lorenz 1984:102})

"we see that it cannot be taken for granted that the migratory storms owe their existence to the instability of a more regular circulation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=6}{Lorenz 1984:103})

"With a further increase in external asymmetry the model also behaves aperiodically, or irregularly" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=8}{Lorenz 1984:105})

"that in general aperiodicity implies instability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=9}{Lorenz 1984:106})

"but contains an infinite complex of manifolds" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=9}{Lorenz 1984:106})

"we wonder whether a rarely visited portion of the attractor be will encountered" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=11}{Lorenz 1984:108})

"In other words, accurate long-range prediction of global weather patterns is impossible, even though some features, such as continental averages, may remain reasonably predictable after other features," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=12}{Lorenz 1984:109})

"current analytical studies may need both observations and computer-generated information, inspired by irregularity, to steer them around similar pitfalls." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHQD3UJ3?page=13}{Lorenz 1984:110})},

\textbf{Extracted Annotations (19/10/2019, 13:23:43)}

"we find that QRA events are likely to increase by \textasciitilde{}50\% this century under business-as-usual carbon emissions, but there is considerable variation among climate models." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"The projections are strongly dependent on assumptions regarding the nature of changes in radiative forcing associated with anthropogenic aerosols over the next century" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"A growing number of studies (3, 7, 8, 11, 14-16, 18-20, 22, 23, 26-28), however, suggest that mechanisms involving atmospheric dynamics are necessary to explain the characteristics\textemdash{}particularly the unusually persistent and amplified disturbances in the jet stream\textemdash{}that are associated with persistent extreme summer weather events" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"Hoskins and Karoly (30) and Hoskins and Ambrizzi (31) demonstrated the potential for waveguide-like behavior for stationary planetary wave" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"behavior, because that profile exhibits substantial variability in time. Petoukhov et al. (11, 22) demonstrated that planetary waves within the synoptic wave number range (wave numbers 6 to 8) can become effectively trapped in a latitudinal waveguide depending on the meridional profile of the midlatitude westerly jet, thus providing a mechanism for the time dependence of resonant" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"l2 The key observation is that can exhibit two turning points, i.e., zero crossings near latitudes of roughly 30\textdegree{}N and 45\textdegree{}N." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=1}{Mann et al 2018:1})

"If the waveguide is (almost) circumglobal, then wave energy is efficiently trapped and waves constructively interfere with the forcing, leading to resonance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=2}{Mann et al 2018:2})

"While both the polar and subtropical boundaries of the waveguide are important, it is the former that is strongly affected by this amplified warming" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=2}{Mann et al 2018:2})

"Even modest model biases in u are likely to propagate into considerably larger biases upon two successive differentiations, making it challenging for even state-of-the-art climate models to correctly model this quantity. Thus, the actual wave dynamics behind QRA are unlikely to be faithfully resolved by the models." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=2}{Mann et al 2018:2})

"We observe a small ensemble mean error of roughly 0.5\% for T(f) [or, alternatively, a still modest roughly 27\% ensemble mean error for dT(f)/df]. For comparison, we obtain a quite d2u( df2 large 344\% error for f)/ (see fig. S1)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=2}{Mann et al 2018:2})

\emph{What you miss in this figure is that individual models have very different slopes -- would be good to see a histogram of the slopes! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MV3TDA26?page=4}{note on p.4})}

"According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) study findings, decentralized wastewater management systems are appropriate for low-density communities and varying site conditions and are more cost-effective than centralized systems" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A8DI42T4?page=1}{Massoud et al 2009:652})

"decentralized systems collect, treat and reuse/dispose treated wastewater at or near the generation point, centralized systems often reuse/dispose far from the generation point. Cluster systems, which can be either centralized or decentralized, serve more than a single household reaching up to 100 homes and more" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A8DI42T4?page=2}{Massoud et al 2009:653})

"Cluster systems are favorable in areas that are more densely populated or that have poor soil conditions and adverse topography" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A8DI42T4?page=2}{Massoud et al 2009:653})

"Thus, constructing a centralized treatment system for small rural communities or peri-urban areas in low income countries will result in burden of debts for the populace (Parkinson and Tayler, 2003; Seidenstat et al., 2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A8DI42T4?page=2}{Massoud et al 2009:653})

"Of all the Turkish municipalities, up to 28 percent are served by septic systems. In other areas, the cluster systems and the package systems also exist (Engin and Demir, 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/A8DI42T4?page=3}{Massoud et al 2009:654})},

"Instead of experience replay, we asynchronously execute multiple agents in parallel, on multiple instances of the environment.

"When an approximate value function is used as the baseline, the quantity used to scale the policy gradient can be seen as Rt bt an estimate of the advantage of action in state , or at st , because is an estimate of A(at ; st ) = Q(at ; st ) V (st ) Rt Q(at ; and is an estimate of (st ) st ) bt V" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4R5GXUEB?page=3}{Mnih et al 2016:3})

"fundamental issue is how best to use uncertain climate information from varied and uncertain sources such as climate projections from general circulation models (GCMs)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=1}{Moody and Brown 2013:3576})

"the climate information from climate ensembles merely provides a lower bound on the maximum range of uncertainty rather than providing forecasts or bounds on uncertainty" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{Moody and Brown 2013:3577})

"Lempert et al. [2004] defined deep uncertainty in the context of Bayesian decision theory as "the condition where the decision maker does not know, or multiple decision makers cannot agree on, the system model, the prior probabilities for the uncertain parameters of the system model and/or the value function.'" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{Moody and Brown 2013:3577})

\emph{I think this is the wrong way to present this idea -- ultimately you are still choosing a best option, but you want to account for its expected utility over a wider range of scenarios, and you may need new metrics of performance. Robustness is not implicitly a performance metric. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{note on p.3577})}

~

"RDM advocates shifting the emphasis from making optimal decisions that maximize economic efficiency to satisficing decisions that provide adequate performance over a wide range of outcomes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{Moody and Brown 2013:3577})

"System performance is frequently expressed in monetary terms such as in benefit-cost analysis or in terms related to system failure such as reliability and vulnerability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{Moody and Brown 2013:3577})

\emph{I think here that the underlying issue is that this is not the utility function itself -- it is just part of it! If your utility function is incomplete, then (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=2}{note on p.3577})}

~

"Lempert and Collins [2007] compared system performance under robust, optimum, and precautionary approaches and also asserted that the best framework is largely dependent on the characterization of uncertainty and on the requirements to communicate decision-related information" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=3}{Moody and Brown 2013:3578})

"RDM to explore policy options over many plausible states. RDM has been widely applied in support of water resource planning [Dessai and Van Der Sluijs, 2007; Groves et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2008d; Joyce et al., 2010]. RDM avoids assigning any single probability to future states, which make it applicable in cases of deeply uncertain future conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=3}{Moody and Brown 2013:3578})

"The work presented here seeks to develop robustness as a function of potential future climate states rather than as a function of specific time series or scenario" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=3}{Moody and Brown 2013:3578})

"Lempert et al. [2006] used a similar process to identify scenarios that lead to poor performance, referring to these scenarios as vulnerabilities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

\emph{This can be useful for many reasons. First, you should explore the full space Utility(x). Second, in a practical sense it might help you identify what x itself is. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{note on p.3579})}

~

"satisfactory system performance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

"Generically, satisfactory system performance can be evaluated in equation (1) using a binary performance function." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

\emph{But why would you do that, since you also need to account for the large costs that your decisions may impose on society if you raise taxes. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{note on p.3579})}

~

"The result can be displayed graphically by considering performance as a function of two predictor variables by considering a planar cross section within the multidimensional climate space." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

\emph{BUT, how do you define your climate phase space? This point becomes key (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{note on p.3579})}

~

"This robustness can be quantified in several ways, including calculating the Euclidean distance, area, or volume in climate space with acceptable performance for a given decision." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

\emph{Again, why would you consider only the "acceptable performance"? This might make sense in some settings, but surely not in the context of trying to decide what to build or how to make trade-offs between large and small investment projects. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{note on p.3579})}

~

"A count of scenarios says nothing about the range over which those scenarios were generated. Thus, the result is dependent on the assumptions related to the distribution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=4}{Moody and Brown 2013:3579})

"used to generate the scenarios" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{Moody and Brown 2013:3580})

\emph{Amen to this (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{note on p.3580})}

~

"Scenario count is meaningless without understanding the ranges over which the scenarios were generated and is also dependent on the sampling of that range." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{Moody and Brown 2013:3580})

"multivariate normal distribution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{Moody and Brown 2013:3580})

\emph{I'm in general skeptical of any paper which needs to define these basic concepts (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{note on p.3580})}

~

"This paper explores two possible assumptions: a uniform distribution applied to a broad range of climate futures and a normal distribution which covers an even wider range but assigns more probability to the central tendencies rather than the extreme values" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Q7MYI6ZU?page=5}{Moody and Brown 2013:3580})

"Part I of this study suggested that a set of daily atmospheric circulation regimes, or weather types, was sensitive to these cross-time scale interferences, conducive to the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in the region, and could be used as a potential predictor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JVQHWGJ6?page=1}{Mu\~noz et al 2016:5915})

"The predominant focus on end-of-century projections neglects more pressing development concerns, which relate to the management of shorter-term risks and climate variability, and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited financial and human resources available to tackle development challenges." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=1}{Nissan et al 2019:579})

"Climate models are unable to represent future conditions at the degree of spatial, temporal, and probabilistic precision with which projections are often provided, which gives a false impression of confidence to users of climate change information." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=1}{Nissan et al 2019:579})

"typically lower adaptive capacities and a higher dependence on rain-fed agriculture, leading to greater impacts from climate and weather shocks" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=2}{Nissan et al 2019:580})

"The prioritization of multidecadal (i.e., more than 30 years ahead) information is incongruous with developmental needs in lowerand middle-income countries and constitutes a substantial opportunity cost for the limited human and financial resources available for climate adaptation and resilience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=2}{Nissan et al 2019:580})

"At worst, we argue, it could even lead to maladaptation (Hall, 2007; Hewitson, Waagsaether, Wohland, Kloppers, \& Kara, 2017)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=2}{Nissan et al 2019:580})

"Decadal component: 17\%" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=3}{Nissan et al 2019:581})

\emph{Here's a variance decomposition -- I'd argue that if you look at the full spectrum of interannual to multidecadal you'd likely get more than the 17\% that they project onto a single (decadal) frequency here (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=3}{note on p.581})}

~

"The difference between (a) and (b) demonstrates that multidecadal projections may not be representative of decadal changes, either because the projections are inaccurate (climate model error) or because of natural decadal variability around the long-term trend. (" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=3}{Nissan et al 2019:581})

\emph{This is a really key point -- often neglected. Cite in current revision. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=3}{note on p.581})}

~

"a failure to acknowledge the limitations of climate change projections for informing policy and decision-making has resulted in a proliferation of suboptimal information that could lead to maladaptation (Adams et al., 2015; Hall, 2007; Hewitson, Daron, Crane, Zermoglio, \& Jack, 2014)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

"Although the limitations of climate change projections are well-documented (Harris et al., 2014; Hazeleger et al., 2015; Smith, 2002; Solomon et al., 2007)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

\emph{For limitations of precip specificallysee the following DOIs\\

"Climate model errors" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

\emph{Great section here (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{note on p.582})}

~

"can provide useful information on appropriate spatial and temporal scales" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

"yet even elementary assessments such as this are not routinely carried out before providing climate change information to stakeholders" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

\emph{These assessments are difficult because they involve deep thinking about probability/stats and climate science but are really important. See our paper http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1 for a poor attempt to look at this (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{note on p.582})}

~

"because on those lead times the uncertainties can be quantified and the forecasts calibrated. However, these methods do not apply to climate change projections" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{Nissan et al 2019:582})

\emph{critical point! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=4}{note on p.582})}

~

"They also assume that statistical relationships seen in the historical record will hold in the future" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{Nissan et al 2019:583})

\emph{For more discussion of statistical downscaling see\\
10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.10.024\\
10.5194/hess-16-3391-2012\\

10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0046.1\\
10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1

These statistical downscaling models are often never evaluated as statistical models -- just used to see that skill scores magically improve and voila! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{note on p.583})}

~

"the collection of models that contribute to the IPCC's future climate projections should not be expected to represent the true range of uncertainty in a meaningful or quantitative way" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{Nissan et al 2019:583})

\emph{I think the point here is that climate model simulations are *not* IID draws from the true distribution of future occurrences. However, I think the term "deep uncertainty" may not be helpful since it refers to some literature that tends to make very specific assumptions (which are of course wrong like all assumptions that we could make) about how to interpret projections (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{note on p.583})}

~

"However, while the models do simulate variability, the timing of flucmodels1 tuations in the models rarely aligns with their timing in the real world, or in other (Baethgen \& Goddard, 2013; Conway, 2011; Lyon \& Vigaud, 2017)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{Nissan et al 2019:583})

\emph{Nor should we expect that they do (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=5}{note on p.583})}

~

"Focusing on projected trends without accounting for decadal variations could thus leave communities more vulnerable to climate shocks and stressors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

\emph{And trends in observation do not imply that they will continue far into the future (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{note on p.584})}

~

"the representation of climate projections for decision-makers tends to be overconfident" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

"High-resolution maps of projected climate change convey a false sense of precision" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

"the timing of modelled decadal and interannual variations, which may be substantial, are not in sync with observed variability (Figure 2 and Section 2.1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

"artificially inflating confidence in the ensemble" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

"Funding from development donors is often contingent on incorporating projections." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{Nissan et al 2019:584})

\emph{A challenge is that many donor agencies require that a particular analysis be done (which they are able to verify) rather than that the planner think hard and critically about the really difficult questions of climate adaptation, which challenge even the world's experts (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=6}{note on p.584})}

~

"The original climate change projections developed for the IPCC were used to weigh the evidence for human impact on the climate, in order to guide policy makers regarding the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=7}{Nissan et al 2019:585})

\emph{Important to understand the history of IPCC (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=7}{note on p.585})}

~

"The inability to verify climate projections against observations at long lead times similarly shields scientists from accountability for the information provided" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=7}{Nissan et al 2019:585})

\emph{Often it's not the climate modelers who are producing these artificially confident products -- it's intermediate analysts. This is at least true in the water community, where climate change scenarios are frequently mis-used. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=7}{note on p.585})}

~

"Some decisions can be managed iteratively through regular reviews or postponed until a later time when uncertainties in relevant aspects of the problem have been reduced through monitoring (Conway \& Schipper, 2010; Michel-Kerjan et al., 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=8}{Nissan et al 2019:586})

\emph{This is important since we are not politically very good at long-term planning (in many places, at least) (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=8}{note on p.586})}

~

"Qualitative projections and uncertainty qualifications may often be sufficient (EFSA, 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=8}{Nissan et al 2019:586})

\emph{I think the piece here is that if you don't have a really good system model and formal decision model, then it's not clear what you would do with high-confidence, high-resolution climate models even if we *could* create them (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=8}{note on p.586})}

~

"Identifying high sensitivities to small changes in weather can guide adaptation decisions without the need for projections (Baethgen et al., 2016; Dessai et al., 2005)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=8}{Nissan et al 2019:586})

"without sufficient data for model evaluation in these regions, the utility of climate model projections is also seriously compromised (Di Luca et al., 2015) and, we assert, dangerously ignored." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=9}{Nissan et al 2019:587})

"Such methods suffer from stationarity problems but are preferable to the use of unverified model output, particularly when observed trends in variability are undetectable or small (Greene, Hellmuth, \& Lumsden, 2012; Greene, Robertson, Smyth, Triglia, \& Greene, 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=9}{Nissan et al 2019:587})

"Such information should be in the form of scenarios, without probabilities attached, provided on coarse spatial scales, and accompanied by clear" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=9}{Nissan et al 2019:587})

"12 statements about the limitations for direct use in decision-making. Anything more is irresponsible (Adams et al., 2015; Daron, Sutherland, et al., 2015; Hewitson et al., 2017; Steynor et al., 2016)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{Nissan et al 2019:588})

"ethical responsibility" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{Nissan et al 2019:588})

"Although intended as mere scenarios of the future, climate change projections are often presented, and interpreted, as quantitatively meaningful forecasts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{Nissan et al 2019:588})

"To facilitate robust decision-making, information is needed about the range of plausible outcomes, not just the best guess given by climate models, which do not represent the true prediction uncertainty (and were never intended to) (Hallegatte, 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{Nissan et al 2019:588})

\emph{This is a repetitive point but it's worth repeating! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{note on p.588})}

~

"decision-relevant timescales" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{Nissan et al 2019:588})

\emph{It's worth thinking about what these timescales are (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=10}{note on p.588})}

~

"particular patterns of circulation in the atmosphere, which may alter with climate change in nonobvious ways that differ from the average" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=11}{Nissan et al 2019:589})

\emph{This is a point we have been working on -- see the two papers I published in 2018 (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=11}{note on p.589})}

~

"When many in the field are willing to provide quick, off-the-shelf answers, a tailored approach may seem expensive and unnecessary" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=11}{Nissan et al 2019:589})

\emph{Crucial point! We need capacity building, not a cottage industry which seeks to provide falsely confident (but unverifiable!) projections to absolve everyone from the collective responsibility for thought! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=11}{note on p.589})}

~

"overconfident," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WK4W6ZD2?page=11}{Nissan et al 2019:589})

\emph{To add one last point: even before all the points considered in this paper, climate models are *conditional on emissions scenarios*, which are created to illustrate reality rather than resemble IID draws from the distribution of all possible emissions scenarios.

"We calibrate the sea-level model using tide gauge observations from Delfzijl, the Netherlands (Fig. S3). We fit mean annual tide gauge observations from a 137-year record to a second-order polynomial approximation using a linear regression model.

\emph{Rather than apply rejection sampling I'd just create some prior distribution over these parameters. Also interesting that they are including autocorrelation structure -- this is also worth maintaining (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BI3WEB6V?page=5}{note on p.5})}

  annotation = {During August 25\textendash{}30, 2017, Hurricane Harvey stalled over Texas and caused extreme precipitation, particularly over Houston and the surrounding area on August 26\textendash{}28. This resulted in extensive flooding with over 80 fatalities and large economic costs. It was an extremely rare event: the return period of the highest observed three-day precipitation amount, 1043.4 mm 3dy-1 at Baytown, is more than 9000 years (97.5\% one-sided confidence interval) and return periods exceeded 1000 yr (750 mm 3dy-1) over a large area in the current climate. Observations since 1880 over the region show a clear positive trend in the intensity of extreme precipitation of between 12\% and 22\%, roughly two times the increase of the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere expected for 1 \textdegree{}C warming according to the Clausius\textendash{}Clapeyron (CC) relation. This would indicate that the moisture flux was increased by both the moisture content and stronger winds or updrafts driven by the heat of condensation of the moisture. We also analysed extreme rainfall in the Houston area in three ensembles of 25 km resolution models. The first also shows 2 \texttimes{} CC scaling, the second 1 \texttimes{} CC scaling and the third did not have a realistic representation of extreme rainfall on the Gulf Coast. Extrapolating these results to the 2017 event, we conclude that global warming made the precipitation about 15\% (8\%\textendash{}19\%) more intense, or equivalently made such an event three (1.5\textendash{}5) times more likely. This analysis makes clear that extreme rainfall events along the Gulf Coast are on the rise. And while fortifying Houston to fully withstand the impact of an event as extreme as Hurricane Harvey may not be economically feasible, it is critical that information regarding the increasing risk of extreme rainfall events in general should be part of the discussion about future improvements to Houston's flood protection system.},

"Unfortunately, our understanding of the dynamical processes that influence such extremes is currently rather poor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"a hint at the primacy of dynamics in understanding future changes in weather and climate extremes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"Such atmospheric Rossby waves can be thought of as describing planetaryscale oscillations in the latitude of the jet stream: the " river" of fast moving air that circumnavigates the planet" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"If we know the (east-west, north-south) orientation of the jet stream at some longitude, we pretty much know what the surface weather will be like at this longitude: if the jet stream isflowing from polar latitudes it will be relatively cold at the surface; if it isflowing from subtropical latitudes it will be relatively warm (and, potentially, relatively wet) at the surfac" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"The authors then provide evidence that although in general it is unlikely that forcing by orography and land/sea thermal contrasts could resonate with the free modes at these particular wave" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"emissions of greenhouse gases, then Rossby wave resonance will be a key mechanism in accounting" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"conditions requires the formation of appropriate waveguides in the longitudinally averagedflow, and this formation process may involve highly nonlinear dynamics (e.g., associated with precursor periods when the Rossby waves break nonlinearly, like ocean waves on a beach)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=1}{Palmer 2013:5281})

"to about 20 km to simulate the large-scale nongaussian" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZQG3P7YK?page=2}{Palmer 2013:5282})

"In climate model simulations, all metrics show that precipitation is less uneven than observed at stations (Fig. 1 orange lines, Table 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZFQKL3Y9?page=6}{Pendergrass and Knutti 2018:6})

"The difference in unevenness between stations and models is thus mostly, but not completely, accounted for by the difference in their resolution." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZFQKL3Y9?page=6}{Pendergrass and Knutti 2018:6})

"Simulated future precipitation is slightly more uneven than simulated present-day precipitation, though the difference is small (Fig. 1c, Table 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZFQKL3Y9?page=6}{Pendergrass and Knutti 2018:6})

"The current narrative is that extreme precipitation change is driven by increasing moisture (with regional modulation by circulation change), while mean precipitation change is muted in comparison because of its role in the planetary energy budget. Our results show that mean and extreme precipitation change have substantial overlap." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZFQKL3Y9?page=7}{Pendergrass and Knutti 2018:7})

"In order to simultaneously invoke explanations of precipitation change based on the energy budget and increasing moisture, the definition of 99.9th extreme precipitation should be very extreme, perhaps the all-day percentile or the wettest day each year."

"Multireservoir systems require robust and adaptive control policies capable of managing hydroclimatic variability and human demands across a range of time scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=1}{Quinn et al 2018:4638})

"we find that reservoir operations designed assuming stationarity provide robust hydropower performance in the Red River but that increased mean streamflow, amplification of the within-year monsoonal cycle, and increased interannual variability all threaten their ability to manage flood risk" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=1}{Quinn et al 2018:4638})

"Designing robust management strategies for multipurpose reservoir system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=1}{Quinn et al 2018:4638})

"(ii) to discover scenarios under which these plans can no longer satisfy system goals and therefore need to be redesigned." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=2}{Quinn et al 2018:4639})

"Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP; Haasnoot et al., 2013) in which decision makers monitor signposts of change that trigger the adoption of different policies when some critical value, or adaptation tipping point (Kwadijk et al., 2010), has been observed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=2}{Quinn et al 2018:4639})

\emph{Useful for me to frame my work as identifying the signposts (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=2}{note on p.4639})}

~

"designing operating policies for the multireservoir Red River system is a challenging multiobjective control problem (Giuliani et al., 2017)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=4}{Quinn et al 2018:4641})

\emph{But why not create a water market and let the different sectors bid against each other (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=4}{note on p.4641})}

~

"The releases feed into the downstream system model that consists of three additional ANNs used to approximate the outputs from a MIKE 11 hydraulic model while speeding up the computational time for optimization" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=5}{Quinn et al 2018:4642})

"Here we calculate a satisficing metric (Starr, 1969) for each design alternative representing the percent of sampled worlds in which minimum performance levels across the system objectives are met." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=5}{Quinn et al 2018:4642})

\emph{I don't much like these because the design of "worlds" is so arbitrary (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=5}{note on p.4642})}

~

\emph{Everyone emphasizes that "we're not estimating probabilities" then take averages over scenarios like this which yields numbers that can only be interpreted in terms of uniform probabilities over samples (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=5}{note on p.4642})}

~

"Figure 2." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=6}{Quinn et al 2018:4643})

\emph{This (flow chart) is a super helpful figure and adds a lot of clarity (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=6}{note on p.4643})}

~

"which is intended to capture the risk aversion of Vietnamese stakeholders with respect to extreme floods and droughts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=6}{Quinn et al 2018:4643})

"again maximize the worst first percentile across the ensemble" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=7}{Quinn et al 2018:4644})

\emph{such an odd thing to optimize (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=7}{note on p.4644})}

~

"Ranges of Hydrologic Factors Sampled in Our Scenario Discovery Analysis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=12}{Quinn et al 2018:4649})

\emph{This is a really helpful set of parameters, not sure about the latin hypercube sampling though (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=12}{note on p.4649})}

~

"Note. States of the world are generated from a Latin hypercube sample across all hydrologic and socioeconomic factors, with each factor sampled uniformly within its bounds" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=13}{Quinn et al 2018:4650})

\emph{I REALLY dislike the combination of these uniform distributions with satisficing metrics. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=13}{note on p.4650})}

~

"While this may sound low, the generated worlds are not equally likely. In fact, some may be extremely unlikely." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=14}{Quinn et al 2018:4651})

\emph{To be fair the above criticism is made fairly here (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=14}{note on p.4651})}

~

"Figure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=15}{Quinn et al 2018:4652})

\emph{But... looking at percent of SOWs begs the reader to misinterpret (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=15}{note on p.4652})}

~

"Moving to Figure 9 the same analysis is applied to analyze the performance of the most robust solutions for hydropower and the deficit. Looking first at panels a and b in the first row (and Tables S3 and S4 of the supporting information), it can be seen that hydropower performance failures for this solution were also found to be most influenced by the log-space annual mean multiplier, m휇 (x axis in panels a and b), log-space multiplier on the amplitude of the first harmonic, mC1 (y axis in panel a), and log-space annual standard deviation multiplier, m휎 (y axis in panel b). To classify successes and failures on the hydropower threshold, we choose the 50\% probability contour from the logistic regression model." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=17}{Quinn et al 2018:4654})

\emph{This communication is tough to follow. Essentially this is a sensitivity analysis of various objectives to projections of future "worlds" onto a few dimensions? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=17}{note on p.4654})}

~

"For the deficit objective, we define failure boundaries using the 75\% probability contour from the logistic regression model" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=19}{Quinn et al 2018:4656})

\emph{Again there are a lot of ad-hoc boundaries that have been introduced here. It seems like a more interesting set of objectives would be\\
* water users\\
* water utility\\
* electricity utility revenue (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=19}{note on p.4656})}

~

"Figure 10. Snapshots of hydrologic factors tracked thro" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=20}{Quinn et al 2018:4657})

\emph{This sort of contextualizing results within climate model projections is really helpful (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=20}{note on p.4657})}

~

"Conclusions and Future Work" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=21}{Quinn et al 2018:4658})

\emph{It seems like a crucial issue here and for decision scaling -- and there are citations of previous work on this -- is what state space the system should be projected onto.\\
Would be interesting to try to do some kind of deep autoencoder to encapsulate all climate onto (say) 5 dimensions in order to inform some goodness of fit parameter, and then to compare how well different state spaces come to approximating it or opening it up for visualization to discover what it thinks matters. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=21}{note on p.4658})}

~

"While the discovery of which hydrologic and socioeconomic factors most influencing system performance could guide water managers in designing more robust operations for the Red River basin and other monsoonal systems, there are many additional uncertain factors beyond the hydrologic and socioeconomic factors sampled here that could further influence operational success." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2HTHSN?page=21}{Quinn et al 2018:4658})

"This is operationalised by including a monitoring system composed of signposts and triggers in the design of the plan." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZSET6YU?page=1}{Raso et al 2019:1})

"the present literature has not considered criteria enabling the a-priori evaluation of the efficacy of signposts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZSET6YU?page=1}{Raso et al 2019:1})

"Signposts specify "the information that should be tracked in order to determine whether the policy is meeting the conditions for its success", triggers specify "critical values of signpost variables beyond which additional pre-specified actions should be implemented" (Haasnoot et al. 2013; Walker et al. 2001; Kwakkel et al. 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZSET6YU?page=2}{Raso et al 2019:2})

\emph{However, what I dislike about this framing is that your analysis is all conducted at once, and then never updated. Perhaps this is a useful step, but there also needs to be a way to update the entire "map" of the future periodically. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XZSET6YU?page=2}{note on p.2})}

This paper isn't very convincing. I don't buy that the signposts are static (ie, not updated in time); that the GEV location parameter of floods is the right way to identify when a project succeeds or fails, etc},

"in practice hydrologic design often mistakenly assumes that the probability of exceedance, p, is constant from year to year which leads to an average return period To equal to 1/p;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{Read and Vogel 2015:6381})

"it does not account for planning horizon, is an average value that may not be representative of the time to the next flood, and is generally not applied in other areas of water planning" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{Read and Vogel 2015:6381})

"under nonstationarity, the underlying distribution of the return period exhibits a more complex shape than the exponential distribution under stationary conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{Read and Vogel 2015:6381})

\emph{from return period to reliability (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{note on p.6381})}

"recommend replacing the average return period with reliability as a more practical way to communicate event likelihood in both stationary and nonstationary contexts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{Read and Vogel 2015:6381})

"the return period has been defined as the (conditional) interval between two flood events [Lloyd, 1970; Haan, 1977; Mays, 2001], whereas the more common definition of a return period in practice is the unconditional waiting time until an exceedance event" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{Read and Vogel 2015:6381})

\emph{return period definition matters (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=1}{note on p.6381})}

"1 p" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{Read and Vogel 2015:6382})

"Such an approach does not consider the risk of failure over the planning horizon as a decision variable, and instead reports this risk of failure as more of a posterior calculation [Yen, 1970]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{Read and Vogel 2015:6382})

\emph{From a CBA framework this still isn't quite getting the key (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{note on p.6382})}

"Risk-Based Decision Making (RBDM) has become a well-established methodology that determines appropriate levels of infrastructure based on the expected damages avoided versus the cost of the infrastructure required" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{Read and Vogel 2015:6382})

"first select a particular design event (a distinct To year event usually specified by regulation), and then select the necessary infrastructure to protect against the flood event with that specified average return period" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{Read and Vogel 2015:6382})

"we recommend no longer using the term risk when discussing the concept defined in equation (4). Instead, we recommend the term "reliability" over a planning period ( Reliabilityn), which is defined as the probability that a system will remain in a satisfactory state [Hashimoto et al., 1982; Salas and Obeysekera, 2014] during its lifetime, i.e., that an exceedance event will not occur within a project life of n years:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{Read and Vogel 2015:6382})

\emph{for the 1 in 1000 year flood, does that mean 0.1\% chance of it happening in next year or expected once over the next 1000 years? Very different (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=2}{note on p.6382})}

"Figure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=3}{Read and Vogel 2015:6383})

\emph{This is a useful figure -- good to remind ourselves that (a) project lifetime matters, and (b) stationary return period and reliability are very different beats (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=3}{note on p.6383})}

"Furthermore, a prerequisite to the use of RBDM under nonstationary conditions is that we develop a complete understanding of the impact of nonstationarity on traditional design metrics such as the expected return period as well as the reliability of a system over its planning horizon."

"We show this to be the case under stationary conditions (Figure 1), and even more dramatically under nonstationary conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=3}{Read and Vogel 2015:6383})

"planners are concerned with knowing whether a system will remain undamaged within a given design period," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=3}{Read and Vogel 2015:6383})

\emph{Again, though, should we not be interested in comparing different plans? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=3}{note on p.6383})}

"risk of failure better describes this likelihood over a planning horizon because it summarizes the joint probability instead of the average probability, and does not require computations involving sums to infinity (i.e., to times beyond the design life)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=4}{Read and Vogel 2015:6384})

"As Salas [2013] notes, the omission of uncertainty from estimating the floodplain is in itself a compounding issue." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=4}{Read and Vogel 2015:6384})

\emph{this could be a good tool for the UK Bristol guy (name?)'s high-res floodplain models (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=4}{note on p.6384})}

"have a very long right tail, thus the mean time to failure (average return period) is a poor representation of the most likely time to failure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=4}{Read and Vogel 2015:6384})

"When a trend exists in annual maximum streamflow" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=5}{Read and Vogel 2015:6385})

\emph{In a risk or cost-benefit framework, whether there is a "trend" or not is a meaningless question... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=5}{note on p.6385})}

"(6)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=5}{Read and Vogel 2015:6385})

\emph{mathematically useful starting point should be this one (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=5}{note on p.6385})}

"(10)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=6}{Read and Vogel 2015:6386})

\emph{Reliability -- more useful computation per these guys (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=6}{note on p.6386})}

"(12)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=6}{Read and Vogel 2015:6386})

\emph{this is also great -- but the huge problem here is that the \$p\_i\$ need to be estimated! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=6}{note on p.6386})}

"the two-parameter lognormal (LN2) model was found by Beard [1974] and others to provide an excellent parsimonious alternative to those models and has since been commonly applied in flood studies [Stedinger and Crainiceanu, 2000; Lund, 2002]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=6}{Read and Vogel 2015:6386})

"Note that we do not advocate the use of a trend model using time as a covariate, this model is only used here for illustrative purposes. We do advocate use of meaningful covariates to reflect future changes in the mean annual flood levels, such as covariates which reflect changes due to urbanization and/or climate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=7}{Read and Vogel 2015:6387})

\emph{GOOD (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=7}{note on p.6387})}

"Under nonstationary conditions, the design flood should be chosen in such a way as to account for the likelihood of future floods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=10}{Read and Vogel 2015:6390})

"in the presence of an increasing trend, the mean return period is actually more representative of the waiting time distribution and may be more representative of when a failure will occur than under stationary conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=11}{Read and Vogel 2015:6391})

\emph{for a positive trend, the pdf becomes much tighter; the mean is thus a better representation (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=11}{note on p.6391})}

"how physical hydrology of the river system affects the probability distribution of the return period under nonstationary conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=11}{Read and Vogel 2015:6391})

"in order to protect against a 100 year flood in a nonstationary setting, the chosen design event X* results in much higher reliabilities than we are normally accustomed to under stationary conditions. The reason, as we observed earlier, is that under nonstationary conditions the distribution of the time to the event of interest becomes much more symmetric and peaked as M increases" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=14}{Read and Vogel 2015:6394})

"probabilistic behavior of the return period and reliability under nonstationary conditions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=15}{Read and Vogel 2015:6395})

"we showed that such trends actually improve our ability to know the time to failure, because the distribution of return periods becomes much more peaked and symmetric, so that the average return period becomes a better indicator of the time to an (exceedance) event." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=16}{Read and Vogel 2015:6396})

"very general understanding of the risk posed by future flood" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/AQBM63KP?page=16}{Read and Vogel 2015:6396})

"The Harvard academicians believed that techniques could be devised to allow planners to take into account far more alternatives than were usually considered with available procedures." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=1}{Reuss 2003:357})

"democratic political arena." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=1}{Reuss 2003:357})

"Hufschmidt and Fier- @ ing \textasciitilde{}1966!; emphasis in the original\#:  1. Specifying the objectives of the design; 2. Translating the objectives into design criteria; 3. Using the design criteria to formulate specific designs for development and management of water-resource systems that fulfill the objectives to the highest degree; and 4. Evaluating the consequences of these designs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=1}{Reuss 2003:357})

"To put it another way, Maass and Hufschmidt \textasciitilde{}1959, p. 115! wrote that "the Harvard Program pro-  ceeds on the assumption that reliance on stream gauging records alone is a weak link in the present methodology."" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=1}{Reuss 2003:357})

"He had sought to show his colleagues that calculations based on the single driest year could lead to serious error, and a few moderately dry years occurring in sequence could require a larger storage capacity \textasciitilde{}Klemes 1997!." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{Reuss 2003:358})

"Students modeled both economic and noneconomic values. Noneconomic values might include environmental quality or the preservation of a well-established ethnic neighborhood" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{Reuss 2003:358})

"ultimate decisions rested in the political sphere" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{Reuss 2003:358})

"but politicians \textasciitilde{}or plan-  ners! must choose the objectives in the first place and select among various options in the end. Trade-offs are necessary" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{Reuss 2003:358})

"multiobjective planning aimed to reach certain social and economic objectives, such as income generation or industrial production, through the manipulation of river systems \textasciitilde{}Reuss 1992!." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{Reuss 2003:358})

\emph{Key point: multiobjective planning doesn't need to be the same as multiobjective optimization. You can use water management to obtain many goals. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=2}{note on p.358})}

"Lehigh study encompassed six reservoirs, nine turbines, water supply diversion works, and storage facilities for flood control and recreation. It included 42 design variables. Sixteen dealt with the components of the structures and 24 dealt with allocation of reservoir capacity according to various purposes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=3}{Reuss 2003:359})

\emph{The kinds of problems that Harvard Water Program was coming up with (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=3}{note on p.359})}

"In this way, the computer simulations painted a picture that did not pretend to mirror the physical world but did show a way to navigate through it. They sensitized engineers and hydrologists to the shortand long-term social and environmental consequences of their decisions and perhaps extended their sense of professional responsibility both spatially and temporally." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=3}{Reuss 2003:359})

"Today, the more likely question is can we afford engineers who do not become involved. The Harvard Water Program offers a template for integrated and improved decision making. We ought to take a second look." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/73MND5TT?page=3}{Reuss 2003:359})

This is a cool take on the harvard water program. It outlines some of the key motivations, challenges, and insights.},

"The kinds of problems that planners deal with--societal problems--are inherently different from the problems that scientists and perhaps some classes of engineers deal with. Planning problems are inherently wicked"

1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem

2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule

3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad

4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem

5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly

6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan

7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique

8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem

9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution

10. The planner has no right to be wrong

"However, there are also many tasks that are more naturally described in terms of multiple, possibly conflicting ob jectives, e.g., a traffic control system should minimize latency and maximize throughput; an autonomous vehicle should minimize both travel time and fuel costs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=2}{Roijers et al 2013:68})

"which cases cannot be trivially reduced to a single-ob jective problem and solved with standard algorithms. To address this, we describe three motivating scenarios for multi-ob jective algorithms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=2}{Roijers et al 2013:68})

"Note that the Bellman equation, which forms the heart of most standard solution algorithms such as dynamic programming (Bellman, 1957b) and temporal-difference methods (Sutton \& Barto, 1998), explicitly relies on the assumption of additive returns" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=3}{Roijers et al 2013:69})

"For any additive infinite-horizon single-objective MDP, there exists a deterministic stationary optimal policy (see e.g., Howard, 1960; Boutilier et al., 1999)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=4}{Roijers et al 2013:70})

"A scalarization function f , is a function that projects the multi-objective {$\pi$} value V to a scalar value" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=5}{Roijers et al 2013:71})

"all research on MOMDPs rests on the premise that there exist tasks for which one or both of these conversion steps is impossible, infeasible, or undesirabl" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=6}{Roijers et al 2013:72})

"In such a scenario, it can be preferable to use a multi-ob jective planning method that computes a set of policies such that, for any price, one of those policies is optimal (see the planning or learning phase in Figure 1a)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=6}{Roijers et al 2013:72})

"For the same reasons, algorithms for MOMDPs can provide critical decision support. Rather than forcing the users to specify w in advance, these algorithms just prune policies that would not be optimal for any w . Then, they offer the users a range of alternatives from which they can select according to preferences whose relative importance is not easily quantified." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=7}{Roijers et al 2013:73})

\emph{I think we should at least engage with this argument since it has a lot of traction (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=7}{note on p.73})}

"In particular, if f is nonlinear, then the resulting single-ob jective MDP may not have additive returns (see Section 4.2.2). As a result, the optimal policy may be non-stationary (see Section 4.3.2) or stochastic (see Section 4.3.3), which cannot occur in single-ob jective, additive, infinite-horizon MDPs (see Theorem 1). Consequently, the MDP can be difficult to solve, as standard methods are not applicable." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=7}{Roijers et al 2013:73})

"For an MOMDP m, the Pareto front is the set of al l policies that are not m Pareto dominated by any other policy in {$\Pi$}" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=15}{Roijers et al 2013:81})

"Multiple-Policy Planning with Linear Scalarization Functions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=21}{Roijers et al 2013:87})

\emph{watch out for linear scalarization functions (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=21}{note on p.87})}

"As mentioned in Section 4.2.2, one way to cope with intractably large Pareto fronts is to compute instead an {\k o}-approximate Pareto front, which can be much smaller" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=24}{Roijers et al 2013:90})

"The general task is to find a control policy for releasing water from a dam while balancing multiple uses of the reservoir, including hydroelectric production and flood mitigation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=30}{Roijers et al 2013:96})

\emph{But you can assign value to these activities! (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X2HGTJ7A?page=30}{note on p.96})}}

Mathematical modelling could benefit from structure and \ding{108} standards based on statistical principles including a systemic appraisal of model uncertainties and parametric sensitivities. Statistics could help by internalising these into its own syllabi \ding{108} and practices. Models-including algorithms, should be made inherently \ding{108} interpretable. For key models used in policy, peer review should be extended \ding{108} to include auditing by an extended community involving a plurality of disciplines and interested actors, leading to model journal3 pedigrees, as discussed on this and more diffusely in 1. ref. Audits could be used to uncover a model's underlying, \ding{108} metaphors1. unspoken," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KG7INAWB?page=2}{Saltelli 2019:2})

"However these techniques have been criticized in [25] and [26] for (in many cases implicitly) assuming that a) all investments are reversible; b) future cashflows and the evolution of relevant variables are certain; c) management is passive and only makes decisions at the start of the project without the ability to postpone or dynamically make changes to the investment; and d) the discount rate can simply be adjusted to consider all the risks in the project."

"The RO models typically considered in the literature fall within three main categories; these are: 1) analytical methods which allows a fast determination of whetherflexibility is present or not in a project; 2) lattices, including standard lattice models taken directly from finance, and adapted lattice models that extend standard models to be applied to physical systems and consider the option value created in the investment timing and in the project's design; and 3) Monte Carlo methods, including standardfinancial models, as well as adapted ones, like the Datar-Mathews model [44], which allows a simple practical approach to valuing projects or the least-squares Monte Carlo method for valuing options with multiple exercise times. All these models will be discussed in detail below." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=3}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:263})

"The investment timing problem was also researched by Bernanke in [55], who found an added value from waiting for better information about the project and its uncertainties" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=4}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:264})

"These highlight the value inflexibility of (i) and (ii) presented above" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=4}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:264})

"Black-Scholes " model", allowed deducing an analytical price for the option by creating a mathematical expression for its value and its dynamics over time." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=4}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:264})

"Thefirst critique to the Black-Scholes and PDE-based models is that only one uncertainty, or at most two correlated ones, can be modeled, making their application difficult for real life projects, as these are subject to many, sometimes uncorrelated (or anyway difficult to realistically quantify), uncertainties" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=4}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:264})

"this single uncertainty is modeled as a geometric Brownian motion (GBM), based on a Wiener proces" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=4}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:264})

"discrete time approximation to the GBM process and assesses the value in exercising an option earlier than at expiry" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=5}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:265})

"Lattice methods are fast, very popular and are analogous to dynamic programming as they rely on backward-recursion through Bellman's optimality principle (see for instance [99,100])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=5}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:265})

\emph{lattice methods are analagous to DP, though not exactly the same (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=5}{note on p.265})}

"This is troublesome since interdependencies between options exist and strongly affect both previous and future decisions [106-108" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=5}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:265})

"as exhaustive search, mixed-integer linear or non-linear programming or stochastic optimization [115,116]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=5}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:265})

"The reason is that these models are forward-looking only while determining the optimal time to invest must be done with backward induction [130]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=6}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:266})

"Nevertheless, it cannot consider the constraints needed for sequential decision-making over time since only the backwardrecursive regression is used to determine the optimal decision policy, while the forward-looking simulations are only used at the start to produce multiple alternatives for the uncertainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=6}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:266})

"Infinancial option theory, the risk-free discount rate is used on the basis of a number of assumptions that are reasonable in stock markets and in particular the absence of arbitrage [51,150] and the market tradability of the asset." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=8}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:268})

"that: (i) at different points in time the attitude to risk of the decision maker might be different and that uncertainty unfolds with tim" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/K5VCAPMU?page=8}{Schachter and Mancarella 2016:268})}

"Cyclones tend to form where surface temperature gradients are large" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=1}{Shaw et al 2016:656})

"Most precipitation extremes over the mid-latitudes occur in cyclones and their associated fronts and warm conveyor belts (WCBs) 4,5 (Fig.~2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=1}{Shaw et al 2016:656})

"Fundamentally, cyclones exist due to baroclinic instability, a fluid dynamical instability characteristic of rotating, stratified fluids17." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=2}{Shaw et al 2016:657})

"Baroclinic instability converts potential energy stored in a longitudinal average of such a fluid into the kinetic energy of growing longitudinally dependent perturbations, that is, trains of cyclones and anticyclones or eddies3,15." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=2}{Shaw et al 2016:657})

"Despite their simplicity, QG theories give a reasonable prediction for the propagation speed and length scale of cyclones." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=2}{Shaw et al 2016:657})

"jet stream, which serves as a wave guide19." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=2}{Shaw et al 2016:657})

"Extending theories to fully include moist processes (Box~1) is an important area of research at present." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"Longitudinal surface asymmetries and quasi-stationary high and low pressure patterns or stationary eddies also help to maintain regional horizontal temperature gradients (see below)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"Storm tracks generally reach maximum intensity (for example, largest number of cyclones) during winter when surface baroclinicity is strongest" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"storm track processes in the upper troposphere drive a separate, eddy-driven jet poleward of the subtropical jet15" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"Cyclones within the storm tracks amplify as they pass through these regions of enhanced baroclinicity3" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

\emph{Maybe interesting to look into the WBC temperature/strength impacts  (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{note on p.658})}

"dissipation occurs over the continents." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"for storm track variations on subseasonal to millennial timescales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"Variations in storm track intensity are manifest as temporal variability in EKE, eddy heat fluxes and baroclinicity38." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=3}{Shaw et al 2016:658})

"increased latent heating in a warmer climate will have a strengthening effect on cyclones" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=4}{Shaw et al 2016:659})

"In models, atmospheric CREs can intensify the jet stream84,85." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=4}{Shaw et al 2016:659})

"The midlatitude circulation response to climate change is also uncertain89" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=4}{Shaw et al 2016:659})

"The simulations also reveal a potential tug of war between the impact of longwave and shortwave cloud changes on surface baroclinicity." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=4}{Shaw et al 2016:659})

"Eddy activity originates at low levels and propagates eastward and upward." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{Shaw et al 2016:660})

"Tropical climate variability across a range of timescales (for example, sub-seasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation to interannual and decadal El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation) drives anomalous stationary eddies that propagate into the extratropics and affect the storm tracks42-44." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{Shaw et al 2016:660})

\emph{this is saying that tropical variability drives stationary eddies that propagate into the extratropics (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{note on p.660})}

"In particular, the jet stream shifted poleward in response to ozone depletion48, consistent with predictions of cyclone49 and storm track40 changes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{Shaw et al 2016:660})

"leads to moister low-level air and greater latent heat release in tropical convection, which warms the tropical upper troposphere relative to the surface and raises the tropopause;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{Shaw et al 2016:660})

"illustrate the multiple opposing thermodynamic influences that make predicting the storm track response to future climate change challenging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=5}{Shaw et al 2016:660})

"Of particular importance when it comes to societal impacts is the change in number, intensity or duration of cyclones" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BEEYP29?page=7}{Shaw et al 2016:662})

"which denes the model component to be a  exible extension of a base model." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7HE8EYCB?page=1}{Simpson et al 2017:1})

"There is a cost to this  exibility. The Bayesian machine is a closed one: given data, an assumed sampling distribution (or likelihood), a prior probability, and perhaps a loss function, this machine will spit out a single answer." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7HE8EYCB?page=2}{Simpson et al 2017:2})

"Unfortunately, as models become more complex the number of methods for specifying joint priors on the parameter space drops o sharply." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7HE8EYCB?page=2}{Simpson et al 2017:2})

"At other times, the statistician can construct an informative, sub jective or expert prior by interviewing experts in order to elicit parameters in a parametric family of priors (Kadane et al., 1980; O'Hagan et al., 2006; Albert et al., 2012; Cooke, 1991; Kurowicka and Cooke, 2006)."

"The priors we develop, which we call Penalised Complexity or PC priors, are informative priors" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7HE8EYCB?page=2}{Simpson et al 2017:2})

"PC priors have a single parameter that the user must set, which controls the amount of  exibility allowed in the model. This parameter can be set using \textbackslash{}weak" information that is frequently available (Gelman, 2006), or by appealing to some other sub jective criterion such as \textbackslash{}calibration" under some assumptions about future experiments (Draper, 2006)."

"The society in this meaning is the sum of individuals, i.e. the aggregated willingness to pay (WTP) for benefits and willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for losses.

I'm not a big fan of the methods used here, but the literature review and description of the problem are helpful. But why this particular subjective set of probabilities? You lose all the structure of your uncertainty.}

"water security is a dynamic concept and must be defined, measured and understood as such" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=1}{Srinivasan et al 2017:12})

\emph{AKA water security is a cool idea but who actually knows what it means or how to measure it (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=1}{note on p.12})}

"The conventional approach to water security as conceptualized and implemented by international agencies (e.g., United Nationals Development Program, UNDP; Global Water Partnership, GWP) is to set standards on how much water needs to be available to meet health, livelihood and ecosystem needs, come up with appropriate indices, and then track progress against them" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

\emph{Standard approach to water (in)security (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{note on p.13})}

"Indeed, typically in the world's poorest countries, due to lack of infrastructure, populations are at risk because they have very little access and control over water." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

""Water security, at any level from the household to the global, means that every person has access to enough safe water at affordable cost to lead a clean, healthy and productive life, while ensuring that the natural environment is protected and enhanced" [17]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

\emph{this definition is right precisely *because* it doesn't mean anything (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{note on p.13})}

"One study of urban water resilience in Chennai [44] showed that as urban households invested in wells, they become individually more water secure in the short-term; but the region as a whole became less resilient and more water insecure in the medium to long term." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

"Investments in drip irrigation improve incomes and allow farmers to expand irrigation at the farm scale, but often make the whole less resilient" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

\emph{Tradeoffs of whole vs individual  (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{note on p.13})}

"Moreover, water is only one factor of production and rarely the primary determinant of economic activity. The" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=2}{Srinivasan et al 2017:13})

"Once we know that a place is water insecure, how do we go about addressing it?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=3}{Srinivasan et al 2017:14})

"we suggest framing water security as an outcome of a coupled human-water systems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=3}{Srinivasan et al 2017:14})

\emph{water security as outcome of a coupled human-water system (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=3}{note on p.14})}

"Because we want to link water security to water governance, in this paper, the partitioning of uses into A, U or N is based on the how the water is sourced and managed" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=3}{Srinivasan et al 2017:14})

\emph{This is pretty goofy, though -- at least they point this out (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=3}{note on p.14})}

"if a watershed has too high a CW but does not produce enough and has too little money to pay for water infrastructure or buy food on grain markets, it is likely to be water insecure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=5}{Srinivasan et al 2017:16})

"A common theme in these studies is that human responses are highly nonlinear. People move, lifestyles change, and values and norms change. Societies respond to the issues/concerns of the day by building infrastructure and trade, constrained by the legacy effects of their previous decisions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=6}{Srinivasan et al 2017:17})

"A society's values, norms and beliefs themselves may evolve over time and these in turn may prompt changes in policy, governance and infrastructure so that, over time, the society might switch to an entirely different trajectory. Such regime shifts cannot obviously be predicted in the conventional sense that hydrologists do predictions, but anticipating these regime shifts can improve predictive insight [43" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=7}{Srinivasan et al 2017:18})

\emph{need for and limitations of prediction (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HF68I4Z3?page=7}{note on p.18})}

See Barendrecht et al (2017) for a companion piece. I like that piece better, but there's some useful stuff here -- particularly in the first two sections -- about what water security is and how our conceptualization of it affects our decisions. I like the "Budyko curve" analogue towards the end, but a not entirely convinced as to their choice of phase space.}

The piece on climate insurance for the poor is interesting, though; private-sector insurance is just a way to manage risk that already exists (even without insurance!) I fully agree that there is a *moral* [plus political/economic] reason to invest in poor people, but it's not clear why flood insurance needs to be fundamentally different from everything else -- with mandatory insurance you will have fewer people dying in extremes and less property damaged which would also be nice! If what it takes to make this work is cash transfers to the poor, then good but why make it insurance specific? Let those who move to low risk area keep their transfer!

TL;DR: price externalities, including disaster relief if you're prepared to do public disaster relief},

"The PP states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing severe harm to the public domain (such as general health or the environment), and in the absence of scientific near-certainty about the safety" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=1}{Taleb et al 2014:1})

"of the action, the burden of proof about absence of harm falls on those proposing the action. It is meant to deal with effects of absence of evidence and the incompleteness of scientific 1 knowledge in some risky domains." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=1}{Taleb et al 2014:1})

"Our aim is to allow decision makers to discern which circumstances require the use of the PP and in which cases evoking the PP is inappropriate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=1}{Taleb et al 2014:1})

"Critics of the PP have also expressed concern that it will be applied in an overreaching manner, eliminating the ability to take reasonable risks that are needed for individual or societal gains" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"Hence, a non-naive view of the precautionary principle is one in which it is only invoked when necessary, and only to prevent a certain variety of very precisely defined risks based on distinctive probabilistic structures" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"probabilistic non-statistical" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"fat tails" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"A ruin problem is one where outcomes of risks have a non-zero probability of resulting in unrecoverable losses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"The large majority of variations that occur within a system, even drastic ones, fundamentally differ from ruin problems: a system that achieves ruin cannot recover" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"the PP is a decisive consideration for ruin problems, while in a broader context precaution is not decisive and can be balanced against other considerations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"By recognizing that normal risks are not in the category of ruin problems, we recognize also that it is not necessary or even normal to take risks that involve a possibility of ruin." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=2}{Taleb et al 2014:2})

"Risk management involves various strategies to make decisions based upon accounting for the effects of positive and negative outcomes and their probabilities, as well as seeking means to mitigate harm and offset losses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=3}{Taleb et al 2014:3})

"The first layer is the PP which addresses cases that involve potential global harm, whether probabilities are uncertain or known and whether they are large or small" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=3}{Taleb et al 2014:3})

"The second is risk management which addresses the case of known probabilities of welldefined, bounded gains and losses" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=3}{Taleb et al 2014:3})

"When the impact of harm extends to all future times, i.e. forever, then the harm is infinite" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=3}{Taleb et al 2014:3})

"Because the "cost" of ruin is effectively infinite, cost-benefit analysis (in which the potential harm and potential gain are multiplied by their probabilities and weighed against each other) is no longer a useful paradigm" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=3}{Taleb et al 2014:3})

"a certain class of systemic risks will remain inherently unknown. In some classes of complex systems, controlled experiments cannot evaluate all of the possible systemic consequences under real-world conditions. In these circumstances, efforts to provide assurance of the "lack of harm" are insufficiently reliable" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=4}{Taleb et al 2014:4})

"The relevance of the precautionary principle today is greater than in the past, owing to the global connectivity of civilization that makes the spreading of effects to places previously insulated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=4}{Taleb et al 2014:4})

"a single deviation will eventually dominate the sum of their effects" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=4}{Taleb et al 2014:4})

"Given a series of events (a sequence of measurements of weight or wealth), in the case of thin tails the sum is proportional to the average, and in the case of fat tails a sum over them may be entirely dominated by a single one." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=4}{Taleb et al 2014:4})

"Whether components are independent or dependent clearly matters to systemic disasters such as pandemics and financial or other crises. Interdependence increases the probability of ruin, ultimately to the point of certainty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=5}{Taleb et al 2014:5})

"natural systems often have fat tail (power law) behaviors associated with the propagation of shocks [3]. This, however, applies to selected systems that do not have barriers (or circuit-breakers) that limit those propagations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=5}{Taleb et al 2014:5})

"The danger we are facing today is that we as a civilization are globally connected, and the fat tail of the distribution of shocks extends globally, to our peril." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=5}{Taleb et al 2014:5})

"Everything that is fragile and still in existence (that is, unbroken), will be harmed more by a certain stressor of intensity than by times a stressor of intensity , up to X k X=k the point of breaking. If I were not fragile (susceptible to harm more than linearly), I would be destroyed by accumulated effects of small events, and thus would not survive" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=6}{Taleb et al 2014:6})

"This explains the necessity of considering scale when invoking the PP." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=6}{Taleb et al 2014:6})

"Hence, because of non-linearities, it is preferable to diversify our effect on the planet, e.g. distinct types of pollutants, across the broadest number of uncorrelated sources of harm, rather than concentrate them" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZNJ76WA8?page=6}{Taleb et al 2014:6})

  annotation = {Bayesian computations can be challenging and there is no guarantee that you will actually be able to implement the model you want. "Fortunately, the structure of the Bayesian joint distribution allows for the validation of any Bayesian computational method capable of producing samples from the posterior distribution, or an approximation thereof"

I need to go into some of the details before implementing, but this (along with the Gabry paper on visualization) is a nice example of how to validate inferences and models. This approach focuses more on whether the computation is correct, while the visualization focuses more on whether the model is useful.

"As relatively rare, severe coastal storm events can cause such dramatic damage and fatalities in the study area, the initial formulation and screening of conceptual "with project" alternatives is using, for common comparison purposes, the mean 1 percent flood with USACE intermediate relative sea level change projection for the identification and evaluation of measures that may be combined to form alternatives for the study area."

"Further, if we compute the squared amplitude of the resulting transform, we can both do away with complex components and remove the phase imparted by the choice of temporal baseline" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=6}{VanderPlas 2017:6})

"the Fourier transform of a convolution is the point-wise product of the individual Fourier transforms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=9}{VanderPlas 2017:9})

"By the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform will be given by the convolution of the transform of the underlying function (here a set of delta functions at the component frequencies) and the transform of the window function (here a sinc function)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=11}{VanderPlas 2017:11})

"When a continuous function is sampled at regular intervals, the delta functions in the Dirac comb window serve to collapse the Fourier integral into a Fourier sum," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=14}{VanderPlas 2017:14})

"In moving from Equation 23 to Equation 24, we have eectively applied to our data a rectangular window function of width N t. From the discussion accompanying Figure 6, we know what this does: it gives us a Fourier transform convolved with a sinc function of width 1=(N t), resulting in the \textbackslash{}smearing" of the Fourier transform signal with this width." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=14}{VanderPlas 2017:14})

"non-structured spacing of observations wil l lead to a non-structured frequency peaks in the window transform." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=16}{VanderPlas 2017:16})

"in general, unevenly-sampled data can probe frequencies far larger than any of these supposed limits (a fact that several of these citations do hint at parenthetically)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=18}{VanderPlas 2017:18})

"considering a generalized form of the periodogram" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=25}{VanderPlas 2017:25})

"A remarkable feature of Scargle's modied periodogram is that it is identical to the result obtained by tting a model consisting of a simple sinusoid to the data at each frequency f and con- 2 structing a \textbackslash{}periodogram" from the goodness-of-t at each frequency" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=25}{VanderPlas 2017:25})

"One important caveat of the simple Lomb-Scargle formula is that the statistical guarantees only apply when the observations have uncorrelated white noise" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=26}{VanderPlas 2017:26})

"unlike the Bayesian periodogram, the standard periodogram aords interpretation in light of Fourier analysis and window functions: here the incorrect sinusoidal model manifests itself in terms of frequency aliases, which can be understood through the analysis of window functions. In most cases of interest, such analysis turns out to be vital to the application and interpretation of the periodogram (see Section 7.2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/MCCKU6PD?page=34}{VanderPlas 2017:34})

"This contrasts with potential bioprotection benefits whereby ivy canopies can reduce temperature fluctuations, prevent water ingress and moderate microclimates, thereby reducing other forms of deterioration. 17,18,19" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NLI9EUTZ?page=4}{Viles et al 2011:28})

"Thus, ivy seems particularly effective at reducing high temperatures during the heat of the day, but is also effective at preventing dips in temperature at night. The differences between ivy-covered and bare surfaces in terms of the daily temperature ranges are statistically significant. 23" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NLI9EUTZ?page=7}{Viles et al 2011:31})

"Other observations within this research project, however, have confirmed the damaging effects that ivy can have on walls. At Gleaston Castle, Gleaston, Cumbria (constructed in the fourteenth century), the ability of ivy to exploit fissures, expand over time and cause significant structural damage to walls is obvious (Figure 9)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NLI9EUTZ?page=13}{Viles et al 2011:37})

"Gleaston highlights the ability of ivy, if left unmonitored, to cause serious weakening and deterioration of wall surfaces." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NLI9EUTZ?page=13}{Viles et al 2011:37})

"but now was much more damaging than it had been" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NLI9EUTZ?page=14}{Viles et al 2011:38})

"A canopy of ivy, which does not need to be very thick, has been proven in our research to have a significant influence on the microclimate at the wall surface. It moderates extremes of temperature and relative humidity, and additionally will stop most rainfall reaching the wall face. Furthermore, along roadside walls or in other locations where fine-grained particulates are a potential problem for soiling and deterioration, ivy leaves have been proven in this research to trap considerable amounts of airborne particles. This paper has also demonstrated that ivy rootlets have no deteriorating effect on stone surfaces, but the possibility that they may damage more sensitive brick and mortar surfaces cannot be ruled out."

"Level 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=2}{Walker et al 2013:396})

\emph{My frustration with this literature is that all of the things we care about are arguably level 5, but all the methods purporting to address this are actually the same as level 2 models, just in an obfuscated manner (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=2}{note on p.396})}

"He defines a Black Swan event as one that lies outside the realm of regular expectations (i.e., "nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=3}{Walker et al 2013:397})

\emph{Arguably these are all events to which we should have assigned non-zero probability (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=3}{note on p.397})}

"Lempert et al. (2003) have defined deep uncertainty as "the condition in which analysts do not know or the parties to a decision cannot agree upon (1) the appropriate models to describe interactions among a system's variables, (2) the probability distributions to represent uncertainty about key parameters in the models, and/or (3) how to value the desirability of alternative outcomes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=3}{Walker et al 2013:397})

\emph{Again, my frustration is that this big-picture thinking doesn't match up with any of the methods I've seen which purport to address deep uncertainty (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=3}{note on p.397})}

"Resistance: plan for the worst conceivable case or future situation, \textbullet{} Resilience: whatever happens in the future, make sure that you have a policy that will result in the system recovering quickly, \textbullet{} Static robustness: implement a (static) policy that will perform reasonably well in practically all conceivable situations, \textbullet{} Adaptive robustness: prepare to change the policy, in case conditions change." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=4}{Walker et al 2013:398})

"Another approach is to ask what one would need to believe was true to discard one possible policy in favor of another. This is the essence of Exploratory Modeling and Analysis (EMA)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=5}{Walker et al 2013:399})

\emph{this at least seems more useful (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=5}{note on p.399})}

"This approach allows implementation to begin prior to the resolution of all major uncertainties, with the policy being adapted over time based on new knowledge" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=5}{Walker et al 2013:399})

"This analysis strongly suggested that airports operating in an ever increasing uncertain environment could significantly improve the adequacy of their long-term development if they planned for adaptation (Kwakkel et al. 2010b, 2010c)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=7}{Walker et al 2013:401})

\emph{But actually choosing which makes more sense ought to depend upon probabilistic estimates of how likely different scenarios are. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YLZCSXAK?page=7}{note on p.401})}},

"sustainable development: "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=2}{Walker et al 2013:956})

"However, most of the important strategic planning problems currently faced by decisionmakers are characterized by uncertainties about the future that cannot be reduced by gathering more information and are not statistical in nature [4]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=2}{Walker et al 2013:956})

""deep uncertainty"\textemdash{}defined as "the condition in which analysts do not know or the parties to a decision cannot agree upon (1) the appropriate models to describe interactions among a system's variables, (2) the probability distributions to represent uncertainty about key parameters in the models, and/or (3) how to value the desirability of alternative outcomes" [4,5]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=3}{Walker et al 2013:957})

"in the face of deep uncertainty it may be wiser to seek among the alternatives those actions that are most robust\textemdash{}that achieve a reasonable level of goodness across the myriad models and assumptions consistent with known facts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=3}{Walker et al 2013:957})

\emph{I have a problem with this, though, because we *do* have some information as to how plausible different scenarios are. In the face of deep uncertainty, if we can still say *something*, then we should not apply a uniform distribution over all scenarios that we come up with -- this gives us a very odd weighting. The key idea is a "set of plausible future states of the world", which is logically defensible but in practice requires probabilities to estimate whether different scenarios are plausible. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=3}{note on p.957})}

"Traditional scenario planning assesses the performance of alternative static plans under different hypothetical futures (e.g., [19,20])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=5}{Walker et al 2013:959})

"since an endpoint in the future is not only determined by what we have experienced in the past and envision for the future, but also by what we will experience on our way to the future [44], how we respond to changes over time, and how our vision for the future changes over time [45]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=9}{Walker et al 2013:963})

\emph{This IS the right question to be asking of our models -- however, we still need to think about how likely these conditions are when we are choosing between different plans (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=9}{note on p.963})}

""under what conditions will a given plan fail"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=9}{Walker et al 2013:963})

"The approach aims at building flexibility into the overall adaptation strategy (rather than into the individual actions) by sequencing the implementation of actions over time in such a way that the system is adapted over time to changing climate, social, economic conditions, etc., and options are left open to deal with a range of plausible future conditions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=9}{Walker et al 2013:963})

"For New York City, an approach is being developed called "flexible adaptation pathways" [61], which shares a strong family resemblance with both the AP approach and Holling's work on adaptive management [62,63]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=10}{Walker et al 2013:964})

"Robust optimization methods aim at finding optimal outcomes in the presence of uncertainty about input parameters [89-92]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=14}{Walker et al 2013:968})

"An information gap is defined as the disparity between what is known and what needs to be known in order to make a reliable and responsible decision." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=15}{Walker et al 2013:969})

""Monitor and adapt" is gradually becoming preferred to "predict and act" as the strategy for long-term planning in the face of deep uncertainty\textemdash{}i.e., as a means to design sustainable plans that are able to achieve economic, environmental, and social objectives for a long-term uncertain future." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2N34UFVY?page=18}{Walker et al 2013:972})

"Despite its simplicity, the new longitude index describes the nonlinear relationship between thefirst two principal components of SST, and unlike previous indices, accounts for background SST changes associated with the seasonal cycle and climate change." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=1}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9236})

\emph{Sorry technical aside -- isn't the point of PCA/EOF to get orthogonal modes of variability?... (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=1}{note on p.9236})}

"We used the average SST over the global tropics to approximate the convective threshold (Johnson \& Xie, 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=2}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9237})

"deep convection, and damping of horizontal buoyancy anomalies by atmospheric gravity waves, keeps the entire tropical troposphere close to a single moist adiabat associated with areas of deep convection (Williams et al., 2009)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=2}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9237})

"similar results can be obtained by replacing the SST-based convective threshold with a threshold in outgoing longwave radiation, a proxy for deep convection (Figure S" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=2}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9237})

"The innovation of ELI is that it tracks the eastward extent and movement of the ascending branch of the Walker Circulation, by making the average longitude of convection the index variable instead of SST anomalies over spatiallyfixed boxes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=2}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9237})

"Modoki events (red circles) have intermediate ELI." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=3}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9238})

"we explored winter averages of thefirst two principal components (PC1 and PC2) of tropical Pacific SST (Figure 3), which together account for 81\% of observed SST variance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=4}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9239})

"On the other hand, the axis of ELI is curved such that it is aligned in the direction of average local variations within the PC1-PC2 plane (black curve in Figure 3a;fitted by regressing PC1 and PC2 onto parametric functions shown in Figure S13), making it thefirst single index capable of characterizing the diversity of ENSO that has previously required multiple indices." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=5}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9240})

"Conventional ENSO indices are calculated from SST anomalies. However, the anomaly required to exceed the convective threshold varies with the background climatology (e.g., Figures 4a and 4b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5URPWL5Q?page=5}{Williams and Patricola 2018:9240})

\emph{I think that this is a good point to make because the valuation that we are trying to do combines real options (eg figure 1) with non-structural instruments and similar (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=2}{note on p.340})}

"Constructing a defence that is inherently flexible and capable of future modification is one approach for implementing a Real Option within a flood risk system." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=3}{Woodward et al 2011:341})

"The decision whether to exercise the option is delayed to a future date when more information regarding future climate change impacts, for example, is known (see Figure 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=3}{Woodward et al 2011:341})

\emph{Outstanding figure, let's use (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=3}{note on p.341})}

"The risk analysis model evaluates the flood risk R of an intervention strategy to enable the benefits of the intervention to be calculated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=5}{Woodward et al 2011:343})

"These include methods such as Laplace's Principle of Insufficient Reason (equal likelihood), Wald's Maximin Model (Wald, 1945) and many derivatives, including the Minimax regret (Eldar et al., 2004). These types of method implicitly reflect a particular attitude to risk. Implementation of Wald's Maximin (Wald, 1945) is well known to be extremely risk averse, for example." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=5}{Woodward et al 2011:343})

\emph{Good and short discussion of the properties of different assumptions for coping with deep uncertainty (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=5}{note on p.343})}

"The Real Options-based strategy and the two traditional strategies consider intervention measures for two epochs only, at 2010 and 2040, to demonstrate, with a simple example, the potential benefits of flexibility within flood risk management strategies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=6}{Woodward et al 2011:344})

\emph{Totally reasonable here but this is an incredibly simple way to frame the real option (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=6}{note on p.344})}

"A constant socioeconomic development scenario has been used throughout" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NIM3JCYW?page=6}{Woodward et al 2011:344})

This is a nice though simple paper. I like the thinking and concision. Figure 1 is worth re-using. The rule is very simple - in the real option case, defenses are widened in 2010 and then in 2040 they are raised to the level needed at that point. The point is that this is more cost-effective than raising the defenses in 2010. Though useful, this seems like only a first step towards identifying how wide and how high and when to raise the levees -- the investment rule here is a very simple one.

\emph{This is almost verbatim a copy of the other paper (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=3}{note on p.77})}

"The intervention measures, coded as decision trees, inherently include flexibility providing opportunities to delay, contract, expand, and abandon investment decisions, depending on how the uncertain future actually unfolds (i.e., how the sea level rises in the case study shown here)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=4}{Woodward et al 2014:78})

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=5}{Woodward et al 2014:79})

"With each of the N initial intervention strategies analyzed according to their objectives (e.g., benefits and costs), the NSGAII operators are applied to create the next generation population of solutions (i.e., strategies). The operators consist of selection, cross-over, and mutation, as shown in Fig. 5. The selection procedure, applied first, determines which strategies will be considered for cross-over and mutation when forming the next generation, with the better performing strategies assigned a higher probability of being selected." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=9}{Woodward et al 2014:83})

\emph{This is interesting -- I think in the discussion of your paper we should point to multi-objective BSV (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=9}{note on p.83})}

"binary tournament selection is used whereby two strategies are picked at random and the better performing strategy of the two will survive into the next generation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=9}{Woodward et al 2014:83})

"In both cases, the intervention strategies consider a planning horizon of 100 years with intervention measures considered at every 50-year time step." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=10}{Woodward et al 2014:84})

"The decision variables that are considered within the intervention strategies include raising the crest level of defenses, increasing the capacity of the defenses for future expansion, and the level of maintenance" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/833AUUPN?page=10}{Woodward et al 2014:84})

This is worth citing because the authors use a good real options / sequential valuation framing, but also use multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm.

"utilities have become more reliant on temporary demand management programs, such as outdoor water use restrictions, for ensuring reliability during drought" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=1}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4939})

"a significant fraction of water utility income is often derived from the volumetric sale of water" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=1}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4939})

"mitigating drought-related revenue losses through the use of thirdparty financial insurance contracts based on streamflow indices" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=1}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4939})

"These measures can delay, or even eliminate, the need for costly infrastructure investments" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=1}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4939})

"their costs are often dominated by invariant debt service payments, and costs, therefore, remain mostly constant despite changes in water production" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=1}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4939})

"In the case of water, natural deviations from typical demand patterns are not often large enough to give rise to significant revenue losses, instead, it is the imposition of water use restrictions that can lead to substantial and immediate reductions in a utility's revenue stream" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=2}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4940})

"To this end, Durham's current pricing structure, demand profile and billing information were integrated with a multireservoir model of its supply system developed in previous work [Palmer and Characklis, 2009]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=2}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4940})

\emph{Look up this model (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=2}{note on p.4940})}

~

"utility managers often find the implementation of substantial drought surcharges to be politically challenging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=2}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4940})

"third-party contracts might be attractive as they involve both constant payments and the insurer absorbing the risks of high-cost, low-frequency events (e.g., multiple droughts over a few years or a long, multiyear drought) that would otherwise require the maintenance of large, infrequently used contingency funds" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=3}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4941})

"Many utilities already use reservoir storage as a trigger for water use restrictions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=3}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4941})

"When inflows to a reservoir in a given week fall below this weekly withdrawal baseline (WB, the reservoir is likely to be drawn down. The deficit that accumulates over time is designated as "drawdown" flows (DF)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=4}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4942})

"The contract price, assumed to be annual, is determined by estimating the expected number of drawdown flows that accumulate in excess of the threshold using the historical (or synthetic) streamflow record." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=4}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4942})

"risk premium (RR)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=4}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4942})

"where standard deviation of annual contract payouts \textonequarter{} and market rate of risk. \textonequarter{}" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=4}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4942})

"a risk premium of 12\% is appropriate benchmark for the relatively simple "drawdown" contracts, described in equation (3)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=4}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4942})

"confound the relationship between streamflow and revenue losses related to water use restrictions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=5}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4943})

"Spillage can be calculated using a water balance model that uses filling flows as the only inputs and draw down flows as the only output" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=6}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4944})

"More sophisticated contracts become attractive when it is considered that utilities often employ water use restrictions in multiple stages, mandating larger reductions in water consumption, and therefore larger revenue shortfalls, as reservoir levels fall" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=6}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4944})

"Fractional Gaussian Noise approach, labeled the "Autocorrelated Bootstrap" method [Kirsch et al., 2012] which reproduces standard statistical moments, as well as variations in the seasonal autocorrelation observed in the historic record" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=7}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4945})

"When estimating revenue losses, the model considers the inverse correlation between demand and streamflow [Mitchell et al., 2001], choosing demand values through use of monthly joint probability density functions (PDFs) derived from the historical demand record (corrected for annual growth) and the corresponding historical streamflow data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=7}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4945})

"Results indicate a 32\% chance of Durham implementing water use restrictions at some point during the year 2015, growing to 37\% by 2025 (Figure 3)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=8}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4946})

"less effective when targeted at only commercial/industrial users or highvolume users ({$>$}11,000 gallons per month)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=8}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4946})

"Drawdown contracts have annual costs of \$0.8MM in 2015, similar to the contribution to a contingency fund maintaining losses below 1\% of annual revenue in 95\% of simulations" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=10}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4948})

"However, DUBSO contracts have slightly higher annual costs (\$1.2MM in 2015) because they provide utilities with payouts slightly higher than their expected revenue losses (Table 1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=10}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4948})

"customers in the form of increased prices. However, the price increases needed to cover these losses/costs will be relatively small. It is worth noting that any lost revenue and/or mitigation costs is likely to eventually be passed along to utility" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/KQE74ELA?page=12}{Zeff and Characklis 2013:4950})},
